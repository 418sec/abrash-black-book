### The Cross Product {#Heading8}

When last we looked at the cross product, we found that it's handy for
generating a vector that's normal to two other vectors. The cross
product is calculated as [u~2~v~3~-u~3~v~2~ u~3~v~1~-u~1~v~3~
u~1~v~2~-u~2~v~1~]. The theoretical minimum cycle count for the cross
product is 21 cycles. Listing 63.4 shows a straightforward
implementation that calculates each component of the result separately,
losing 15 cycles to stalls.

        fld     [vec0+8]         ;starts & ends on cycle 2
        fmul    [vec1+4]         ;starts on cycle 3

        fstp    [vec2+0]         ;starts on cycle 10,
                                 ; ends on cycle 11
        fld     [vec0+8]         ;starts & ends on cycle 12
        fmul    [vec1+0]         ;starts on cycle 13
        fld     [vec0+0]         ;starts & ends on cycle 14
        fmul    [vec1+8]         ;starts on cycle 15
                                 ;stalls for cycles 16-17
        fsubrp  st(1),st(0)      ;starts on cycle 18
                                 ;stalls for cycles 19-21
        fstp    [vec2+4]         ;starts on cycle 22,
                                 ; ends on cycle 23

        fld     [vec0+0]         ;starts & ends on cycle 24
        fmul    [vec1+4]         ;starts on cycle 25
        fld     [vec0+4]         ;starts & ends on cycle 26
        fmul    [vec1+0]         ;starts on cycle 27
                                 ;stalls for cycles 28-29
        fsubrp  st(1),st(0)      ;starts on cycle 30
                                 ;stalls for cycles 31-33
        fstp    [vec2+8]         ;starts on cycle 34,
                                 ; ends on cycle 35
```

We couldn't get rid of many of the stalls in the dot product code
because with six inputs and one output, it was impossible to interleave
all the operations. However, the cross product, with three outputs, is
much more amenable to optimization. In fact, three is the magic number;
because we have three calculation streams and the latency of FADD, FSUB,
and FMUL is 3 cycles, we can eliminate almost every single stall in the
cross-product calculation, as shown in Listing 63.5. Listing 63.5 loses
only one cycle to a stall, the cycle before the first FST; the relevant
FSUB has just finished on the preceding cycle, so we run into the extra
cycle of latency associated with FST. Listing 63.5 is more than 60
percent faster than Listing 63.4, a striking illustration of the power
of properly managing the Pentium's FP pipeline.

### Transformation {#Heading9}

Transforming a point, for example from worldspace to viewspace, is one
of the most heavily used FP operations in realtime 3-D. Conceptually,
transformation is nothing more than three dot products and three
additions, as I will discuss in Chapter 61. (Note that I'm talking about
a subset of a general 4x4 transformation matrix, where the fourth row is
always implicitly [0 0 0 1]. This limited form suffices for common
transformations, and does 25 percent less work than a full 4x4
transformation.)

Transformation is calculated as:

    v1      m11 m12 m13 m14    u1
    v2  =   m21 m22 m23 m24    u2
    v3      m31 m32 m33 m34    u3
    1       0   0   0   1      1

or

    v1 = m11u1 + m12u2 + m13u3 + m14
    v2 = m21u1 + m22u2 + m23u3 + m24
    v3 = m31u1 + m32u2 + m33u3 + m34.
