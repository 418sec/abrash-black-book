<H3><A NAME="Heading2"></A>Knowing When to Hurl Conventional Math Wisdom Out the Window</H3>
<P>In a crisis, sometimes it&rsquo;s best to go with the first solution that comes into your head&mdash;but not very often.
</P>
<P>When I turned 16, my mother had an aging, three-cylinder Saab&mdash;not one of the sporty Saabs that appeared in the late &rsquo;70s, but a blunt-nosed, ungainly little wagon that seated up to seven people in sardine-like comfort, with two of them perched on the gas tank. That was the car I learned to drive on, and the one I took whenever I wanted to go somewhere and my mother didn&rsquo;t need it.</P>
<P>My father&rsquo;s car, on the other hand, was a Volvo sedan, only a couple of years old and easily the classiest car my family had ever owned. To the best of my recollection, as of New Year&rsquo;s of my senior year, I had never driven that car. However, I was going to a New Year&rsquo;s party&mdash;in fact, I was going to chauffeur four other people&mdash;and for reasons lost in the mists of time, I was allowed to take the Volvo. So, one crystal clear, stunningly cold night, I picked up my passengers, who included Robin Viola, Kathy Smith, Jude Hawron...and Alan, whose last name I&rsquo;ll omit in case he wants to run for president someday.</P>
<P>The party was at Craig Alexander&rsquo;s house, way out in the middle of nowhere, and it was a good one. I heard Al Green for the first time, much beer was consumed (none by me, though), and around 2 a.m., we decided it was time to head home. So we piled into the Volvo, cranked the heat up to the max, and set off.</P>
<P>We had gone about five miles when I sensed Alan was trying to tell me something. As I turned toward him, he said, quite expressively, &ldquo;BLEARGH!&rdquo; and deposited a considerable volume of what had until recently been beer and chips into his lap.</P>
<P>Mind you, this wasn&rsquo;t just any car Alan was tossing his cookies in&mdash;it was my father&rsquo;s prized Volvo. My reactions were up to the task; without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, I shouted, &ldquo;Do it out the window! Open the window!&rdquo; Alan obligingly rolled the window down and, with flawless aim, sent some more erstwhile beer and chips on its way.</P>
<P>And it was here that I learned that fast decisions are not necessarily good decisions. A second after the liquid flew out the window, there was a loud smacking sound, and a yelp from Robin, as the sodden mass hit the slipstream and splattered along the length of the car. At that point, I did what I should have done in the first place; I stopped the car so Alan could get out and finish being sick in peace, while I assessed the full dimensions of the disaster. Not only was the rear half of the car on the passenger side&mdash;including Robin&rsquo;s window, accounting for the yelp&mdash;covered, but the noxious substance had frozen solid. It looked like someone had melted an enormous candle, or possibly put cake frosting on the car.</P>
<P>The next morning, my father was remarkably good-natured about the whole thing, considering, although I don&rsquo;t remember ever actually driving the Volvo again. My penance consisted of cleaning the car, no small punishment considering that I had to take a hair dryer out to our unheated garage and melt and clean the gunk one small piece at a time.</P>
<P>One thing I learned from this debacle is to pull over very, very quickly if anyone shows signed of being ill, a bit of wisdom that has proven useful a suprising number of times over the years. More important, though, is the lesson that it almost always pays to take at least a few seconds to size up a crisis situation and choose an effective response, and that&rsquo;s served me well more times than I can count.</P>
<P>There&rsquo;s a surprisingly close analog to this in programming. Often, when faced with a problem in his or her code, a programmer&rsquo;s response is to come up with a solution as quickly as possible and immediately hack it in. For all but the simplest problems, though, there are side effects and design issues involved that should be thought through before any coding is done. I try to think of bugs and other problem situations as opportunities to reexamine how my code works, as well as chances to detect and correct structural defects I hadn&rsquo;t previously suspected; in fact, I&rsquo;m often able to simplify code as I fix a bug, thanks to the understanding I gain in the process.</P>
<P>Taking that a step farther, it&rsquo;s useful to reexamine assumptions periodically even if no bugs are involved. You might be surprised at how quickly assumptions that once were completely valid can deteriorate.</P>
<P>For example, consider floating-point math.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading3"></A>Not Your Father&rsquo;s Floating-Point</H3>
<P>Until last year, I had never done any serious floating-point (FP) optimization, for the perfectly good reason that FP math had never been fast enough for any of the code I needed to write. It was an article of faith that FP, while undeniably convenient, because of its automatic support for constant precision over an enormous range of magnitudes, was just not fast enough for real-time programming, so I, like pretty much everyone else doing 3-D, expended a lot of time and effort in making fixed-point do the job.
</P>
<P>That article of faith was true up through the 486, but all the old assumptions are out the window on the Pentium, for three reasons: faster FP instructions, a pipelined floating-point unit (FPU), and the magic of a parallel FXCH. Taken together, these mean that FP addition and subtraction are nearly as fast as integer operations, and FP multiplication and division have the potential to be much faster&mdash;all with the range and precision advantages of FP. Better yet, the FPU has its own set of eight registers, so the use of floating-point can help relieve pressure on the x86&rsquo;s integer registers, as well.</P>
<P>One effect of all this is that with the Pentium, floating-point on the x86 has gone from being irrelevant to real-time 3-D to being a key element. Quake uses FP all the way down into the inner loop of the span rasterizer, performing several FP operations every 16 pixels.</P>
<P>Floating-point has not only become important for real-time 3-D on the PC, but will soon become even more crucial. Hardware accelerators will take care of texture mapping and will increase feasible scene complexity, meaning the CPU will do less bit-twiddling and will have far more vertices to transform and project, and far more motion physics and line-of-sight calculations and the like as well.</P>
<P>By way of getting you started with floating-point for real-time 3-D, in this chapter I&rsquo;ll examine the basics of Pentium FP optimization, then look at how some key mathematical techniques for 3-D&mdash;dot product, cross product, transformation, and projection&mdash;can be accelerated.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading4"></A>Pentium Floating-Point Optimization</H3>
<P>I&rsquo;m going to assume you&rsquo;re already familiar with x86 FP code in general; for additional information, check out Intel&rsquo;s <I>Pentium Processor User&rsquo;s Manual</I> (order #241430-001; 1-800-548-4725), a book that you should have if you&rsquo;re doing Pentium programming of any sort. I&rsquo;d also recommend taking a look around <A HREF="http://www.intel.com">http://www.intel.com</A>.</P>
<P>I&rsquo;m going to focus on six core instructions in this section: FLD, FST, FADD, FSUB, FMUL, and FDIV. First, let&rsquo;s look at cycle times for these instructions. FLD takes 1 cycle; the value is pushed onto the FP stack and ready for use on the next cycle. FST takes 2 cycles, although when storing to memory, there&rsquo;s a potential extra cycle that can be lost, as I&rsquo;ll describe shortly.</P><P><BR></P>
