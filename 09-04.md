    ; Searches a text buffer for a text string. Uses REPNZ SCASB to scan
    ; the buffer for locations that match a specified character of the
    ; searched-for string, then uses REPZ CMPS to check fully only those
    ; locations that REPNZ SCASB has identified as potential matches.

    ;     unsigned int BufferLength, unsigned char * SearchString,
    ;     unsigned int SearchStringLength,

    ; Returns a pointer to the first match for SearchString in Buffer,or
    ; a NULL pointer if no match is found. Buffer should not start at
    ; offset 0 in the data segment to avoid confusing a match at 0 with
    ; no match found.
