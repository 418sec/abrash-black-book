**LISTING 14.1 L14-1.C**

```c
/* Searches a buffer for a specified pattern. In case of a mismatch,
   uses the value of the mismatched byte to skip across as many
   potential match locations as possible (partial Boyer-Moore).
   Returns start offset of first match searching forward, or NULL if
   no match is found.
   Tested with Borland C++ in C mode and the small model. */

Well, architecture carries a lot of weight, but it sure as heck isn't
destiny. I had simply fallen into the trap of figuring that the
algorithm was so clever that I didn't have to do any thinking myself.
The path leading to `REPNZ SCASB` from the original brute-force
approach of `REPZ CMPSB` at every location had been based on my
observation that the first character comparison at each buffer location
usually fails. Why not apply the same concept to Boyer-Moore? Listing
14.3 is just like the standard implementation—except that it's optimized
to handle a first-comparison mismatch as quickly as possible in the loop
at `QuickSearchLoop`, much as `REPNZ SCASB` optimizes
first-comparison mismatches for the brute-force approach. The results in
Table 14.1 speak for themselves; Listing 14.3 is more than twice as fast
as what I assure you was already a nice, tight assembly implementation
(and unrolling `QuickSearchLoop` could boost performance by up to 10
percent more). Listing 14.3 is also *four times* faster than `REPNZ
SCASB` in one case.
