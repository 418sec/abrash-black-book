  <p>Listings 8.5 and 8.6 together go the final step and change the rules in favor of assembly language. Listing 8.5 creates the same list of linked blocks as Listing 8.1. However, instead of storing an array of structures within each block, it stores <i>two</i> arrays in each block, one consisting of ID numbers and the other consisting of the corresponding values, as shown in Figure 8.3. No information is lost; the data is merely rearranged.</p>

/* Program to search an array spanning a linked list of variable-
   sized blocks, for all entries with a specified ID number,
   and return the average of the values of all such entries. Each of
   the variable-sized blocks may contain any number of data entries,
   stored in the form of two separate arrays, one for ID numbers and
   one for values. */

  <p>The whole point of this rearrangement is to allow us to use <b>REP SCASW</b> to search through each block, and that&rsquo;s exactly what <b>FindIDAverage2</b> in Listing 8.6 does. The result: Listing 8.6 calculates the average about <i>three times</i> as fast as the original C implementation and more than twice as fast as Listing 8.4, heavily optimized as the latter code is.</p>

  <p>I trust you get the picture. The sort of instruction-by-instruction optimization that so many of us love to do as a kind of puzzle is fun, but compilers can do it nearly as well as you can, and in the future will surely do it better. What a compiler <i>can&rsquo;t</i> do is tie together the needs of the program specification on the high end and the processor on the low end, resulting in critical code that runs just about as fast as the hardware permits. The only software that can do that is located north of your sternum and slightly aft of your nose. Dust it off and put it to work&mdash;and your code will never again be confused with anything by Hamilton, Joe, Frank, eynolds or Bo Donaldson and the Heywoods.</p>
