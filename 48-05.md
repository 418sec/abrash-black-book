Listing 48.3 has an important limitation: It does not guarantee proper
handling when the source and destination overlap, as in the case of a
downward scroll, for example. Listing 48.3 performs top-to-bottom,
left-to-right copying. Downward scrolls require bottom-to-top copying;
likewise, rightward horizontal scrolls require right-to-left copying. As
it happens, my intended use for Listing 48.3 is to copy images between
off-screen memory and on-screen memory, and to save areas under pop-up
menus and the like, so I don't really need overlap handling—and I do
really need to keep the complexity of this discussion down. However, you
will surely want to add overlap handling if you plan to perform
arbitrary scrolling and copying in display memory.

Now that we have a fast way to copy images around in display memory, we
can draw icons and other images as much as four times faster than in
mode 13H, depending on the speed of the VGA's display memory. (In case
you're worried about the nibble-alignment limitation on fast copies,
don't be; I'll address that fully in due time, but the secret is to
store all four possible rotations in off-screen memory, then select the
correct one for each copy.) However, before our fast display
memory-to-display memory copy routine can do us any good, we must have a
way to get pixel patterns from system memory into display memory, so
that they can then be copied with the fast copy routine.

#### Copying to Display Memory {#Heading5}

The final piece of the puzzle is the system memory to
display-memory-copy-routine shown in Listing 48.4. This routine assumes
that pixels are stored in system memory in exactly the order in which
they will ultimately appear on the screen; that is, in the same linear
order that mode 13H uses. It would be more efficient to store all the
pixels for one plane first, then all the pixels for the next plane, and
so on for all four planes, because many **OUT**s could be avoided, but
that would make images rather hard to create. And, while it is true that
the speed of drawing images is, in general, often a critical performance
factor, the speed of copying images from system memory to display memory
is not particularly critical in Mode X. Important images can be stored
in off-screen memory and copied to the screen via the latches much
faster than even the speediest system memory-to-display memory copy
routine could manage.

I'm not going to present a routine to perform Mode X copies from display
memory to system memory, but such a routine would be a straightforward
inverse of Listing 48.4.

### Who Was that Masked Image Copier? {#Heading6}

At this point, it's getting to be time for us to take all the Mode X
tools we've developed, together with one more tool—masked image
copying—and the remaining unexplored feature of Mode X, page flipping,
and build an animation application. I hope that when we're done, you'll
agree with me that Mode X is *the* way to animate on the PC.

In truth, though, it matters less whether or not *you* think that Mode X
is the best way to animate than whether or not your users think it's the
best way based on results; end users care only about results, not how
you produced them. For my writing, you folks are the end users—and
notice how remarkably little you care about how this book gets written
and produced. You care that it turned up in the bookstore, and you care
about the contents, but you sure as heck don't care about how it got
that far from a bin of tree pulp. When you're a creator, the process
matters. When you're a buyer, results are everything. All important.
*Sine qua non.* The whole enchilada.

If you catch my drift.
