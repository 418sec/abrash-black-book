<P>Back-to-front or front-to-back traversal in itself wouldn&rsquo;t be so impressive&mdash;there are many ways to do that&mdash;were it not for one additional detail: The traversal can always be performed in linear time, as we&rsquo;ll see later on. For instance, you can traverse, a polygon list back-to-front from any viewpoint simply by walking through the corresponding BSP tree once, visiting each node one and only one time, and performing only one relatively inexpensive test at each node.
</P>
<P>It&rsquo;s hard to get cheaper sorting than linear time, and BSP-based rendering stacks up well against alternatives such as z-buffering, octrees, z-scan sorting, and polygon sorting. Better yet, a scene database represented as a BSP tree can be clipped to the view pyramid very efficiently; huge chunks of a BSP tree can be lopped off when clipping to the view pyramid, because if the entire area or volume of a node lies entirely outside the view volume, then <I>all</I> nodes and leaves that are children of that node must likewise be outside the view volume, for reasons that will become clear as we delve into the workings of BSP trees.</P>

<H4 ALIGN="LEFT"><A NAME="Heading5"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">Limitations of BSP Trees</FONT></H4>
<P>Powerful as they are, BSP trees aren&rsquo;t perfect. By far the greatest limitation of BSP trees is that they&rsquo;re time-consuming to build, enough so that, for all practical purposes, BSP trees must be precalculated, and cannot be built dynamically at runtime. In fact, a BSP-tree compiler that attempts to perform some optimization (limiting the number of surfaces that need to be split, for example) can easily take minutes or even hours to process large world databases.
</P>
<P>A fixed world database is fine for walkthrough or flythrough applications (where the viewpoint moves through a static scene), but not much use for games or virtual reality, where objects constantly move relative to one another. Consequently, various workarounds have been developed to allow moving objects to appear in BSP tree-based scenes. DOOM, for example, uses 2-D sprites mixed into BSP-based 3-D scenes; note, though, that this approach requires maintaining z information so that sprites can be drawn and occluded properly. Alternatively, movable objects could be represented as separate BSP trees and merged anew into the world BSP tree with each move. Dynamic merging may or may not be fast enough, depending on the scene, but merging BSP trees tends to be quicker than building them, because the BSP trees being merged are already spatially sorted.</P>
<P>Another possibility would be to generate a per-pixel z-buffer for each frame as it&rsquo;s rendered, to allow dynamically changing objects to be drawn into the BSP-based world. In this scheme, the BSP tree would allow fast traversal and clipping of the complex, static world, and the z-buffer would handle the relatively localized visibility determination involving moving objects. The drawback of this is the need for a memory-hungry z-buffer; a typical 640x480 z-buffer requires a fairly appalling 600K, with equally appalling cache-miss implications for performance.</P>
<P>Yet another possibility would be to build the world so that each dynamic object falls entirely within a single subspace of the static BSP tree, rather than straddling splitting lines or planes. In this case, dynamic objects can be treated as points, which are then just sorted into the BSP tree on the fly as they move.</P>
<P>The only other drawbacks of BSP trees that I know of are the memory required to store the tree, which amounts to a few pointers per node, and the relative complexity of debugging BSP-tree compilation and usage; debugging a large data set being processed by recursive code (which BSP code tends to be) can be quite a challenge. Tools like the BSP compiler I&rsquo;ll present in the next chapter, which visually depicts the process of spatial subdivision as a BSP tree is constructed, help a great deal with BSP debugging.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading6"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">Building a BSP Tree</FONT></H3>
<P>Now that we know a good bit about what a BSP tree is, how it helps in visible surface determination, and what its strengths and weaknesses are, let&rsquo;s take a look at how a BSP tree actually works to provide front-to-back or back-to-front ordering. This chapter&rsquo;s discussion will be at a conceptual level, with plenty of figures; in the next chapter we&rsquo;ll get into mechanisms and implementation details.
</P>
<P>I&rsquo;m going to discuss only 2-D BSP trees from here on out, because they&rsquo;re much easier to draw and to grasp than their 3-D counterparts. Don&rsquo;t worry, though; the principles of 2-D BSP trees using line segments generalize directly to 3-D BSP trees using polygons. Also, 2-D BSP trees are quite powerful in their own right, as evidenced by DOOM, which is built around 2-D BSP trees.</P>
<P>First, let&rsquo;s construct a simple BSP tree. Figure 59.2 shows a set of four lines that will constitute our sample world. I&rsquo;ll refer to these as walls, because that&rsquo;s one easily-visualized context in which a 2-D BSP tree would be useful in a game. Think of Figure 59.2 as depicting vertical walls viewed from directly above, so they&rsquo;re lines for the purpose of the BSP tree. Note that each wall has a front side, denoted by a normal (perpendicular) vector, and a back side. To make a BSP tree for this sample set, we need to split the world in two, then each part into two again, and so on, until each wall resides in its own unique subspace. An obvious question, then, is how should we carve up the world of Figure 59.2?</P>

</P>
<P>There are infinitely valid ways to carve up Figure 59.2, but the simplest is just to carve along the lines of the walls themselves, with each node containing one wall. This is not necessarily optimal, in the sense of producing the smallest tree, but it has the virtue of generating the splitting lines without expensive analysis. It also saves on data storage, because the data for the walls can do double duty in describing the splitting lines as well. (Putting one wall on each splitting line doesn&rsquo;t actually create a unique subspace for each wall, but it does create a unique subspace <I>boundary</I> for each wall; as we&rsquo;ll see, that spatial organization provides for the same unambiguous visibility ordering as a unique subspace would.)</P><P><BR></P>
