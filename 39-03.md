Listing 39.2 shows a C implementation of integer edge tracing. Vertical
and diagonal lines, which are trivial to trace, are special-cased. Other
lines are broken into two categories: Y-major (closer to vertical) and
X-major (closer to horizontal). The handlers for the Y-major and X-major
cases operate on the principle of similar triangles: The number of X
pixels advanced per scan line is the same as the ratio of the X delta of
the edge to the Y delta. Listing 39.2 is more complex than the original
floating point implementation, but not painfully so. In return for that
complexity, Listing 39.2 is more than 80 times faster at scanning
edgesâ€”and, as just mentioned, it's actually more accurate than the
floating point code.

Ya gotta love that integer arithmetic.

**LISTING 39.2 L39-2.C**

```c
/* Scan converts an edge from (X1,Y1) to (X2,Y2), not including the
   point at (X2,Y2). If SkipFirst == 1, the point at (X1,Y1) isn't
   drawn; if SkipFirst == 0, it is. For each scan line, the pixel
   closest to the scanned edge without being to the left of the
   scanned edge is chosen. Uses an all-integer approach for speed and
   precision. */

### The Finishing Touch: Assembly Language {#Heading6}

The C implementation in Listing 39.2 is now nearly 20 times as fast as
the original, which is good enough for most purposes. Still, it requires
that one of the large data models be used (for **memset** ), and it's
certainly not the fastest possible code. The obvious next step is
assembly language.

Listing 39.3 is an assembly language version of
**DrawHorizontalLineList** . In actual use, it proved to be about 36
percent faster than Listing 39.1; better than a poke in the eye with a
sharp stick, but just barely. There's more to these timing results than
meets that eye, though. Display memory generally responds much more
slowly than system memory, especially in 386 and 486 systems. That means
that much of the time taken by Listing 39.3 is actually spent waiting
for display memory accesses to complete, with the processor forced to
idle by wait states. If, instead, Listing 39.3 drew to a local buffer in
system memory or to a particularly fast VGA, the assembly implementation
might well display a far more substantial advantage over the C code.
