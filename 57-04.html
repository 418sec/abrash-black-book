<P>Within Listing 57.2, all the important optimization is in the loop that draws across each destination scan line, near the end of the listing. One optimization is elimination of the call to the set-pixel routine used to draw each pixel in Listing 57.1. Function calls are expensive operations, to be avoided when performance matters. Also, although Mode X (the undocumented 320&#165;240 256-color VGA mode X-Sharp runs in) doesn&#146;t lend itself well to pixel-oriented operations like line drawing or texture mapping, the inner loop has been set up to minimize Mode X&#146;s overhead. A rotating plane mask is maintained in AL, with DX pointing to the Map Mask register; thus, only a rotate and an <B>OUT</B> are required to select the plane to which to write, cycling from plane 0 through plane 3 and wrapping back to 0. Better yet, because we know that we&#146;re simply stepping horizontally across the destination scan line, we can use a clever optimization to both step the destination and reduce the overhead of maintaining the mask. Two copies of the current plane mask are maintained, one in each nibble of AL. (The Map Mask register pays attention only to the lower nibble.) Then, when one copy rotates out of the lower nibble, the other copy rotates into the lower nibble and is ready to be used. This approach eliminates the need to test for the mask wrapping from plane 3 to plane 0, all the more so because a carry is generated when wrapping occurs, and that carry can be added to DI to advance the screen pointer. (Check out the next chapter, however, to see the best Map Mask optimization of all&#151;setting it once and leaving it unchanged.)</P>
<P>In all, the overhead of drawing each pixel is reduced from a call to the set-pixel routine and full calculation of the screen address and plane mask to five instructions and no branches. This is an excellent example of converting full, from-scratch calculations to incremental processing, whereby only information that has changed since the last operation (the plane mask moving one pixel, for example) is recalculated.</P>
<P>Incremental processing and knowing where the cycles go are both important in the final optimization in Listing 57.2, speeding up the retrieval of pixels from the texture map. This operation looks very efficient in Listing 57.1, consisting of only two adds and the macro <B>GET- IMAGE-PIXEL</B>. However, those adds are fixed-point adds, so they take four instructions apiece, and the macro hides not only conversion from fixed-point to integer, but also a time-consuming multiplication. Incremental approaches are excellent at avoiding multiplication, because cumulative additions can often replace multiplication. That&#146;s the case with stepping through the source texture in Listing 57.2; ten instructions, with a maximum of two branches, replace all the texture calculations of Listing 57.1. Listing 57.2 simply detects when the fractional part of the source x or y coordinate turns over and advances the source texture pointer accordingly.</P>
<P>As you might expect, all this optimization is pretty hard to implement, and makes Listing 57.2 much more complicated than Listing 57.1. Is it worth the trouble? Indeed it is. Listing 57.2 is more than twice as fast as Listing 57.1, and the difference is very noticeable when large, texture-mapped areas are animated. Whether more than doubling performance is significant is a matter of opinion, I suppose, but imagine that you&#146;re in William Gibson&#146;s <I>Neuromancer</I>, trying to crack a corporate database. Which texture-mapping routine would you rather have interfacing you to Cyberspace?</P>
<P>I&#146;m always interested in getting your feedback on and hearing about potential improvements to X-Sharp. Contact me through the publisher. There is no truth to the rumor that I can be reached under the alias &#147;sheep-shearer,&#148; at least not for another 9,999 sheep.</P><P><BR></P>
