### Faster Addressing and More {#Heading7}

I'll spend the rest of this chapter covering a variety of Pentium
optimization tips. For starters, effective address calculations (that
is, the addition and scaling required to calculate a memory operand's
address, as for example in **MOV EAX,[EBX+ECX\*2+4]**) never take any
extra cycles on the Pentium (other than possibly an AGI cycle), even for
the use of base+index addressing (as in **MOV [ESI+EDI],EAX**) or
scaling (\*2, \*4, or \*8, as in **INC ARRAY[ESI\*4]**). On the 486,
both of the latter cases cause a 1-cycle penalty. The faster effective
address calculations have the side effect of making **LEA** very
attractive as an arithmetic instruction. **LEA** can add any two
registers, one of which can be multiplied by one, two, four, or eight,
plus a constant value, and can store the result in any register—all in
one cycle, apart from AGIs. Not only that, but as we'll see in the next
chapter, **LEA** can go through either pipe, whereas **SHL** can only go
through the U-pipe, so **LEA** is often a superior choice for
multiplication by three, four, five, eight, or nine. (**ADD** is the
best choice for multiplication by two.) If you use **LEA** for
arithmetic, do remember that unlike **ADD** and **SHL**, it doesn't
modify any flags.

As on the 486, memory operands should not cross any more alignment
boundaries than absolutely necessary. Word operands should be
word-aligned, dword operands should be dword-aligned, and qword operands
(double-precision variables) should be qword-aligned. Spanning a dword
boundary, as in

    mov ebx,3
     :
    mov eax,[ebx]

costs three cycles. On the other hand, as noted above, branch targets
can now span cache lines with impunity, so on the Pentium there's no
good argument for the paragraph (that is, 16-byte) alignment that Intel
recommends for 486 jump targets. The 32-byte alignment might make for
slightly more efficient Pentium cache usage, but would make code much
bigger overall.

Instruction prefixes are awfully expensive; avoid them if you can.
(These include size and addressing prefixes, segment overrides,
**LOCK**, and the 0FH prefixes that extend the instruction set with
instructions such as **MOVSX**. The exceptions are conditional jumps, a
fast special case.) At a minimum, a prefix byte generally takes an extra
cycle and shuts down the V-pipe for that cycle, effectively costing as
much as two normal instructions (although prefix cycles can overlap with
previous multicycle instructions, or AGIs, as on the 486). This means
that using 32-bit addressing or 32-bit operands in a 16-bit segment, or
vice versa, makes for bigger code that's significantly slower. So, for
example, you should generally avoid 16-bit variables (shorts, in C) in
32-bit code, although if using 32-bit variables where they're not needed
makes your data space get a lot bigger, you may want to stick with
shorts, especially since longs use the cache less efficiently than
shorts. The trade-off depends on the amount of data and the number of
instructions that reference that data. (eight-bit variables, such as
chars, have no extra overhead and can be used freely, although they may
be less desirable than longs for compilers that tend to promote
variables to longs when performing calculations.) Likewise, you should
if possible avoid putting data in the code segment and referring to it
with a CS: prefix, or otherwise using segment overrides.

**LOCK** is a particularly costly instruction, especially on
multiprocessor machines, because it locks the bus and requires that the
hardware be brought into a synchronized state. The cost varies depending
on the processor and system, but **LOCK** can make an **INC [*mem*]**
instruction (which normally takes 3 cycles) 5, 10, or more cycles
slower. Most programmers will never use **LOCK** on purpose—it's
primarily an operating system instruction—but there's a hidden gotcha
here because the **XCHG** instruction always locks the bus when used
with a memory operand.

As with the 486, don't use **ENTER** or **LEAVE**, which are slower than
the equivalent discrete instructions. Also, start using **TEST
*reg,reg*** instead of **AND *reg,reg*** or **OR *reg,reg*** to test
whether a register is zero. The reason, as we'll see in Chapter 21, is
that **TEST**, unlike **AND** and **OR**, never modifies the target
register. Although in this particular case **AND** and **OR** don't
modify the target register either, the Pentium has no way of knowing
that ahead of time, so if **AND** or **OR** goes through the U-pipe, the
Pentium may have to shut down the V-pipe for a cycle to avoid potential
dependencies on the result of the **AND** or **OR**. **TEST** suffers
from no such potential dependencies.
