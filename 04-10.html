<TABLE WIDTH="100%">
<TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="5%"><IMG SRC="images/04-03i.jpg"><TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="95%"><SMALL><I>A line-drawing subroutine, which executes perhaps a dozen instructions for each display memory access, generally loses less performance to the display adapter cycle-eater than does a block-copy or scrolling subroutine that uses <B>REP MOVS</B> instructions. Scaled and three-dimensional graphics, which spend a great deal of time performing calculations (often using very slow floating-point arithmetic), tend to suffer less.</I></SMALL>
</TABLE>
<P>In addition, code that accesses display memory infrequently tends to suffer only about half of the maximum display memory wait states, because on average such code will access display memory halfway between one available display memory access slot and the next. As a result, code that accesses display memory less intensively than the code in Listing 4.11 will on average lose 4 or 5 rather than 8-plus cycles to the display adapter cycle-eater on each memory access.
</P>
<P>Nonetheless, the display adapter cycle-eater always takes its toll on graphics code. Interestingly, that toll becomes much higher on ATs and 80386 machines because while those computers can execute many more instructions per microsecond than can the 8088-based PC, it takes just as long to access display memory on those computers as on the 8088-based PC. Remember, the limited speed of access to a graphics adapter is an inherent characteristic of the adapter, so the fastest computer around can&#146;t access display memory one iota faster than the adapter will allow.</P>
<H4 ALIGN="LEFT"><A NAME="Heading22"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">What to Do about the Display Adapter Cycle-Eater?</FONT></H4>
<P>What can we do about the display adapter cycle-eater? Well, we can minimize display memory accesses whenever possible. In particular, we can try to avoid read/modify/write display memory operations of the sort used to mask individual pixels and clip images. Why? Because read/modify/write operations require two display memory accesses (one read and one write) each time display memory is manipulated. Instead, we should try to use writes of the sort that set all the pixels in a given byte of display memory at once, since such writes don&#146;t require accompanying read accesses. The key here is that only half as many display memory accesses are required to write a byte to display memory as are required to read a byte from display memory, mask part of it off and alter the rest, and write the byte back to display memory. Half as many display memory accesses means half as many display memory wait states.
</P>
<TABLE WIDTH="100%"><TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="5%"><IMG SRC="images/04-04i.jpg"><TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="95%"><SMALL><I>Moreover, 486s and Pentiums, as well as recent Super VGAs, employ write-caching schemes that make display memory writes considerably faster than display memory reads.</I></SMALL>
</TABLE>
<P>Along the same line, the display adapter cycle-eater makes the popular exclusive-OR animation technique, which requires paired reads and writes of display memory, less-than-ideal for the PC. Exclusive-OR animation should be avoided in favor of simply writing images to display memory whenever possible.
</P>
<P>Another principle for display adapter programming on the 8088 is to perform multiple accesses to display memory very rapidly, in order to make use of as many of the scarce accesses to display memory as possible. This is especially important when many large images need to be drawn quickly, since only by using virtually every available display memory access can many bytes be written to display memory in a short period of time. Repeated string instructions are ideal for making maximum use of display memory accesses; of course, repeated string instructions can only be used on whole bytes, so this is another point in favor of modifying display memory a byte at a time. (On faster processors, however, display memory is so  slow that it often pays to do several instructions worth of work between display memory accesses, to take advantage of cycles that would otherwise be wasted on the wait states.)</P>
<P>It would be handy to explore the display adapter cycle-eater issue in depth, with lots of example code and execution timings, but alas, I don&#146;t have the space for that right now. For the time being, all you really need to know about the display adapter cycle-eater is that on the 8088 you can lose more than 8 cycles of execution time on each access to display memory. For intensive access to display memory, the loss really can be as high as 8cycles (and up to 50, 100, or even more on 486s and Pentiums paired with slow VGAs), while for average graphics code the loss is closer to 4 cycles; in either case, the impact on performance is significant. There is only one way to discover just how significant the impact of the display adapter cycle-eater is for any particular graphics code, and that is of course to measure the performance of that code.</P>

<P>We&#146;ve covered a great deal of sophisticated material in this chapter, so don&#146;t feel bad if you haven&#146;t understood everything you&#146;ve read; it will all become clear from further reading, especially once you study, time, and tune code that you have written yourself. What&#146;s really important is that you come away from this chapter understanding that on the 8088:
</P>
<DL>
<DD><B>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The 8-bit bus cycle-eater causes each access to a word-sized operand to be 4 cycles longer than an equivalent access to a byte-sized operand.
<DD><B>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The prefetch queue cycle-eater can cause instruction execution times to be as much as four times longer than the officially documented cycle times.
<DD><B>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The DRAM refresh cycle-eater slows most PC code, with performance reductions ranging as high as 8.33 percent.
<DD><B>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The display adapter cycle-eater typically doubles and can more than triple the length of the standard 4-cycle access to display memory, with intensive display memory access suffering most.
</DL>
<P>This basic knowledge about cycle-eaters puts you in a good position to understand the results reported by the Zen timer, and that means that you&#146;re well on your way to writing high-performance assembler code.
</P>
<H4 ALIGN="LEFT"><A NAME="Heading24"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">What Does It All Mean?</FONT></H4>
<P>There you have it: life under the programming interface. It&#146;s not a particularly pretty picture for the inhabitants of that strange realm where hardware and software meet are little-known cycle-eaters that sap the speed from your unsuspecting code. Still, some of those cycle-eaters can be minimized by keeping instructions short, using the registers, using byte-sized memory operands, and accessing display memory as little as possible. None of the cycle-eaters can be eliminated, and dynamic RAM refresh can scarcely be addressed at all; still, aren&#146;t you better off knowing how fast your code <I>really</I> runs&#151;and why&#151;than you were reading the official execution times and guessing? And while specific cycle-eaters vary in importance on later x86-family processors, with some cycle-eaters vanishing altogether and new ones appearing, the concept that understanding these obscure gremlins is a key to performance remains unchanged, as we&#146;ll see again and again in later chapters.</P><P><BR></P>
