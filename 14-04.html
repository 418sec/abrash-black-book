<P>Well, architecture carries a lot of weight, but it sure as heck isn&rsquo;t destiny. I had simply fallen into the trap of figuring that the algorithm was so clever that I didn&rsquo;t have to do any thinking myself. The path leading to <B>REPNZ SCASB</B> from the original brute-force approach of <B>REPZ CMPSB</B> at every location had been based on my observation that the first character comparison at each buffer location usually fails. Why not apply the same concept to Boyer-Moore? Listing 14.3 is just like the standard implementation&mdash;except that it&rsquo;s optimized to handle a first-comparison mismatch as quickly as possible in the loop at <B>QuickSearchLoop</B>, much as <B>REPNZ SCASB</B> optimizes first-comparison mismatches for the brute-force approach. The results in Table 14.1 speak for themselves; Listing 14.3 is more than twice as fast as what I assure you was already a nice, tight assembly implementation (and unrolling <B>QuickSearchLoop</B> could boost performance by up to 10 percent more). Listing 14.3 is also <I>four times</I> faster than <B>REPNZ SCASB</B> in one case.</P><P><BR></P>
