  <p>Well, architecture carries a lot of weight, but it sure as heck isn&rsquo;t destiny. I had simply fallen into the trap of figuring that the algorithm was so clever that I didn&rsquo;t have to do any thinking myself. The path leading to <b>REPNZ SCASB</b> from the original brute-force approach of <b>REPZ CMPSB</b> at every location had been based on my observation that the first character comparison at each buffer location usually fails. Why not apply the same concept to Boyer-Moore? Listing 14.3 is just like the standard implementation&mdash;except that it&rsquo;s optimized to handle a first-comparison mismatch as quickly as possible in the loop at <b>QuickSearchLoop</b>, much as <b>REPNZ SCASB</b> optimizes first-comparison mismatches for the brute-force approach. The results in Table 14.1 speak for themselves; Listing 14.3 is more than twice as fast as what I assure you was already a nice, tight assembly implementation (and unrolling <b>QuickSearchLoop</b> could boost performance by up to 10 percent more). Listing 14.3 is also <i>four times</i> faster than <b>REPNZ SCASB</b> in one case.</p>
