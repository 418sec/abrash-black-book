### Optimization beyond the Pale {#Heading2}

When I was in high school, my gym teacher had us run a race around the
soccer field, or rather, around a course marked with cones that roughly
outlined the shape of the field. I quickly settled into second place
behind Dwight Chamberlin. We cruised around the field, and when we came
to the far corner, Dwight cut across the corner, inside a cone placed
awkwardly far out from the others. I followed, and everyone else cut
inside the cone too—except the pear-shaped kid bringing up the rear, who
plodded his way around every single cone on his way to finishing about
half a lap behind. When the laggard finally crossed the finish line, the
coach named him the winner, to my considerable irritation. After all,
the object was to see who could run the fastest, wasn’t it?

Actually, it wasn’t. The object was to see who could run the fastest
according to the limitations placed upon the contest. This is a crucial
distinction, although usually taken for granted. Would it have been
legitimate if I had cut across the middle of the field? If I had ridden
a bike? If I had broken the world record for the 100 meters by dropping
100 meters from a plane? Competition has meaning only within a carefully
circumscribed arena.

Why am I telling you this? First, because it is a useful lesson for
programming.

  ![](images/i.jpg)   *All programming is performed within limitations, some of which can be bent or changed, but many of which cannot. You cannot change the maximum memory bandwidth of a VGA, or the maximum instruction execution rate of a 486. That is why the stunning 3D demos you see at SIGGRAPH have only passing relevance to everyday life on the desktop. A rule that Intel’s chip designers cannot break is 8086 compatibility, much as I’m sure they’d like to, but of course the flip side is that although RISC chips are technically superior, they command but a small fraction of the market; raw performance is not the arena of competition. Similarly, you will often be unable to change the specifications for the software you implement.*

### Breaking the Rules {#Heading3}

The other reason for the anecdote has to do with the way my second
Optimization Challenge worked itself out. If you’ll recall from the last
chapter, the challenge I made to the readers of *PC TECHNIQUES* was to
devise the fastest possible version of the Game of Life cellular
automata simulation game. I gave an example, laid out the rules, and
stood aside. Good thing, too. *Apres moi, le deluge....*

And when the dust had settled, I was left with the uneasy realization
that every submitted entry broke the rules. *Every single entry*. The
rules clearly stated that submitted code must produce *exactly the same
output* as my example implementation under all circumstances in order to
be eligible to win. I do not think that there can be any question about
what “exactly the same output” means. It means the same pixels, in the
same colors, at the same places on the screen at the same points in all
the Life simulations that the original code was capable of running.
Period. And not one of the entries met that standard. Some submitted
listings were more than 400 lines long. Some didn’t display the
generation number at the right side of the screen, didn’t draw the same
pixel colors, or didn’t bother with magnification. Some had bugs. Some
didn’t support all possible cellmap widths and heights up to 200x200,
requiring widths and heights that were specific multiples of a number of
cells that lent itself to a particular implementation.

This last mission is, in a way, a brilliant approach, as evidenced by
the fact that it yielded the two fastest submissions, but it is not
within the rules of the contest. Some of the rule-breaking was major,
some very minor, and some had nothing to do with the Life engine itself,
but the rules were clear; where was I to draw the line if not with exact
compliance? And I was fully prepared to draw that line rigorously,
disqualifying some mind-bending submissions in order to let lesser but
fully compliant entries win—until I realized that there *were* no fully
compliant entries.

Given which, I heaved a sigh of relief, threw away the rules, and picked
a winner in the true spirit of the contest: raw speed. Two winners, in
fact: Peter Klerings, a programmer for Turck GmbH in Munich, Germany,
whose entry just plain runs like a bat out of hell, and David Stafford
(who was also the winner of my first Optimization Challenge), of Borland
International, whose entry is slightly slower mainly because he didn’t
optimize the drawing part of the program, in full accordance with the
contest rules, which specifically excluded drawing time from
consideration. Unfortunately, Peter’s generation code and drawing code
are so tightly intertwined that it is impossible to separate them, and
hence not really possible to figure out whose generation engine is
faster. Anyway, at 180 to 200 generations per second, including drawing
time, for 200x200 cellmaps (and in the neighborhood of *1000* gps for
96x96 cellmaps, the size of my original implementation), they’re the
fastest submissions I received. They’re both more than an order of
magnitude faster than my final optimized C++ Life implementation shown
in Chapter 17, and more than 300 times faster than my original,
perfectly functional Life implementation. Not 300 percent—300 *times*.
Cell generations scud across the screen like clouds, and walkers shoot
out like bullets. Each is a worthy winner, and I feel confident that the
true objective of the challenge has been met: pure, breathtaking
*speed*.

Notwithstanding, *mea culpa*. The next time I lay a challenge, I will
define the rules with scrupulous care. Even so, this was much more than
just another cycle-counting contest. We’re fortunate enough to be privy
to a startling demonstration of the power of the best optimizer anyone
has yet devised—you. (That’s the general “you”; I realize that the
specific “you” may or may not be quite up to the optimizing level of the
specific “David Stafford” or “Peter Klerings.”)

Onward to the code.
