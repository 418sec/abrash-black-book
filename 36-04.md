Notwithstanding that it's not optimized, Listing 36.1 is reasonably
fast. If you run Listing 36.2 (a sample line-drawing program that you
can use to test-drive Listing 36.1), you may be as surprised as I was at
how quickly the screen fills with vectors, considering that Listing 36.1
is entirely in C and has some redundant divides. Or perhaps you won't be
surprisedâ€”in which case I suggest you *not* miss the next chapter.
