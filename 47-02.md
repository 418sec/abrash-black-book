Given the tremendous advantages of Mode X over the documented mode 13H,
I'd very much like to get it into the hands of as many developers as
possible, so I'm going to spend the next few chapters exploring this odd
but worthy mode. I'll provide mode set code, delineate the bitmap
organization, and show how the basic write pixel and read pixel
operations work. Then, I'll move on to the magic stuff: rectangle fills,
screen clears, scrolls, image copies, pixel inversion, and, yes, polygon
fills (just a different driver for the polygon code), all blurry fast;
hardware raster ops; and page flipping. In the end, I'll build a working
animation program that shows many of the features of Mode X in action.

The mode set code is the logical place to begin.

### Selecting 320x240 256-Color Mode {#Heading4}

We could, if we wished, write our own mode set code for Mode X from
scratch—but why bother? Instead, we'll let the BIOS do most of the work
by having it set up mode 13H, which we'll then turn into Mode X by
changing a few registers. Listing 47.1 does exactly that.

The code in Listing 47.1 has been around for some time, and the very
first version had a bug that serves up an interesting lesson. The
original *DDJ* version made images roll on IBM's fixed-frequency VGA
monitors, a problem that didn't come to my attention until the code was
in print and shipped to 100,000 readers.

The bug came about this way: The code I modified to make the Mode X mode
set code used the VGA's 28-MHz clock. Mode X should have used the 25-MHz
clock, a simple matter of setting bit 2 of the Miscellaneous Output
register (3C2H) to 0 instead of 1.

Alas, I neglected to change that single bit, so frames were drawn at a
faster rate than they should have been; however, both of my monitors are
multifrequency types, and they automatically compensated for the faster
frame rate. Consequently, my clock-selection bug was invisible and
innocuous—until it was distributed broadly and everybody started banging
on it.

IBM makes only fixed-frequency VGA monitors, which require very specific
frame rates; if they don't get what you've told them to expect, the
image rolls. The corrected version is the one shown here as Listing
47.1; it does select the 25-MHz clock, and works just fine on
fixed-frequency monitors.

Why didn't I catch this bug? Neither I nor a single one of my testers
had a fixed-frequency monitor! This nicely illustrates how difficult it
is these days to test code in all the PC-compatible environments in
which it might run. The problem is particularly severe for small
developers, who can't afford to buy every model of every hardware
component from every manufacturer; just imagine trying to test
network-aware software in all possible configurations!

When people ask why software isn't bulletproof; why it crashes or
doesn't coexist with certain programs; why PC clones aren't always
compatible; why, in short, the myriad irritations of using a PC
exist—this is a big part of the reason. I guess that's just the price we
pay for the unfettered creativity and vast choice of the PC market.
