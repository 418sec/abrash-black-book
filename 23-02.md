### At the Core {#Heading5}

A little background is necessary before we’re ready to examine Listing
23.1. The VGA is built around four functional blocks, named the CRT
Controller (CRTC), the Sequence Controller (SC), the Attribute
Controller (AC), and the Graphics Controller (GC). The single-chip VGA
could have been designed to treat the registers for all the blocks as
one large set, addressed at one pair of I/O ports, but in the EGA, each
of these blocks was a separate chip, and the legacy of EGA compatibility
is why each of these blocks has a separate set of registers and is
addressed at different I/O ports in the VGA.

Each of these blocks has a sizable complement of registers. It is not
particularly important that you understand why a given block has a given
register; all the registers together make up the programming interface,
and it is the entire interface that is of interest to the VGA
programmer. However, the means by which most VGA registers are addressed
makes it necessary for you to remember which registers are in which
blocks.

Most VGA registers are addressed as *internally indexed* registers. The
internal address of the register is written to a given block’s Index
register, and then the data for that register is written to the block’s
Data register. For example, GC register 8, the Bit Mask register, is set
to 0FFH by writing 8 to port 3CEH, the GC Index register, and then
writing 0FFH to port 3CFH, the GC Data register. Internal indexing makes
it possible to address the 9 GC registers through only two ports, and
allows the entire VGA programming interface to be squeezed into fewer
than a dozen ports. The downside is that two I/O operations are required
to access most VGA registers.

The ports used to control the VGA are shown in Table 23.1. The CRTC, SC,
and GC Data registers are located at the addresses of their respective
Index registers plus one. However, the AC Index and Data registers are
located at the same address, 3C0H. The function of this port toggles on
every **OUT** to 3C0H, and resets to Index mode (in which the Index
register is programmed by the next **OUT** to 3C0H) on every read from
the Input Status 1 register (3DAH when the VGA is in a color mode,

3BAH in monochrome modes). Note that all CRTC registers are addressed at
either 3DXH or 3BXH, the former in color modes and the latter in
monochrome modes. This provides compatibility with the register
addressing of the now-vanished Color/Graphics Adapter and Monochrome
Display Adapter.

The method used in the VGA BIOS to set registers is to point DX to the
desired Index register, load AL with the index, perform a byte **OUT**,
increment DX to point to the Data register (except in the case of the
AC, where DX remains the same), load AL with the desired data, and
perform a byte **OUT**. A handy shortcut is to point DX to the desired
Index register, load AL with the index, load AH with the data, and
perform a word **OUT**. Since the high byte of the **OUT** value goes to
port DX+1, this is equivalent to the first method but is faster.
However, this technique does not work for programming the AC Index and
Data registers; both AC registers are addressed at 3C0H, so two separate
byte **OUT**s must be used to program the AC. (Actually, word **OUT**s
to the AC do work in the EGA, but not in the VGA, so they shouldn’t be
used.) As mentioned above, you must be sure which mode—Index or Data—the
AC is in before you do an **OUT** to 3C0H; you can read the Input Status
1 register at any time to force the AC to Index mode.

How safe is the word-**OUT** method of addressing VGA registers? I have,
in the past, run into adapter/computer combinations that had trouble
with word **OUT**s; however, all such problems I am aware of have been
fixed. Moreover, a great deal of graphics software now uses word
**OUT**s, so any computer or VGA that doesn’t properly support word
**OUT**s could scarcely be considered a clone at all.

  ![](images/i.jpg)   *A speed tip: The setting of each chip’s Index register remains the same until it is reprogrammed. This means that in cases where you are setting the same internal register repeatedly, you can set the Index register to point to that internal register once, then write to the Data register multiple times. For example, the Bit Mask register (GC register 8) is often set repeatedly inside a loop when drawing lines. The standard code for this is:*
  ------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

         MOV     DX,03CEH   ;point to GC Index register
         MOV     AL,8       ;internal index of Bit Mask register
         OUT     DX,AX      ;AH contains Bit Mask register setting

  -- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     *Alternatively, the GC Index register could initially be set to point to the Bit Mask register with*
  -- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

         MOV     DX,03CEH  ;point to GC Index register
         MOV     AL,8      ;internal index of Bit Mask register
         OUT     DX,AL     ;set GC Index register
         INC     DX        ;point to GC Data register

  -- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     *and then the Bit Mask register could be set repeatedly with the byte-size **OUT** instruction*
  -- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

         OUT     DX,AL    ;AL contains Bit Mask register setting

  -- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     *which is generally faster (and never slower) than a word-sized **OUT**, and which does not require AH to be set, freeing up a register. Of course, this method only works if the GC Index register remains unchanged throughout the loop.*
