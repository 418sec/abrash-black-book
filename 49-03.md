It would be handy to have a function that, given a base image and mask,
generates the four image and mask alignments and fills in the
**MaskedImage** structure. Listing 49.3, together with the include file
in Listing 49.4 and the system memory-to-display memory block-copy
routine in Listing 48.4 (in the previous chapter) does just that. It
would be faster if Listing 49.3 were in assembly language, but there's
no reason to think that generating aligned images needs to be
particularly fast; in such cases, I prefer to use C, for reasons of
coding speed, fewer bugs, and maintainability.

**LISTING 49.3 L49-3.C**

    /* Generates all four possible mode X image/mask alignments, stores image
    alignments in display memory, allocates memory for and generates mask
    alignments, and fills out an AlignedMaskedImage structure. Image and mask must
    both be in byte-per-pixel form, and must both be of width ImageWidth. Mask
    maps isomorphically (one to one) onto image, with each 0-byte in mask masking
    off corresponding image pixel (causing it not to be drawn), and each non-0-byte
    allowing corresponding image pixel to be drawn. Returns 0 if failure, or # of
    display memory addresses (4-pixel sets) used if success. For simplicity,
    allocated memory is not deallocated in case of failure. Compiled with
    Borland C++ in C compilation mode. */

#### Notes on Masked Copying {#Heading5}

Listings 49.1 and 49.2, like all Mode X code I've presented, perform no
clipping, because clipping code would complicate the listings too much.
While clipping can be implemented directly in the low-level Mode X
routines (at the beginning of Listing 49.1, for instance), another,
potentially simpler approach would be to perform clipping at a higher
level, modifying the coordinates and dimensions passed to low-level
routines such as Listings 49.1 and 49.2 as necessary to accomplish the
desired clipping. It is for precisely this reason that the low-level
Mode X routines support programmable start coordinates in the source
images, rather than assuming (0,0); likewise for the distinction between
the width of the image and the width of the area of the image to draw.

Also, it would be more efficient to make up structures that describe the
source and destination bitmaps, with dimensions and coordinates built
in, and simply pass pointers to these structures to the low level,
rather than passing many separate parameters, as is now the case. I've
used separate parameters for simplicity and flexibility.

  ![](images/i.jpg)   *Be aware that as nifty as Mode X hardware-assisted masked copying is, whether or not it's actually faster than software-only masked or transparent copying depends upon the processor and the video adapter. The advantage of Mode X masked copying is the 32-bit parallelism; the disadvantages are the need to read display memory and the need to perform an **OUT** for every four pixels. (**OUT** is a slow 486/Pentium instruction, and most VGAs respond to **OUT**s much more slowly than to display memory writes.)*
