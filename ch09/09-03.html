<P>Listing 9.1 implements the scan-on-first-character approach. Listing 9.2 scans for whatever character the caller specifies. Listing 9.3 is a test program used to compare the two approaches. How much difference does Rob&#146;s revelation make? Plenty. Even when the entire C function call to <B>FindString</B> is timed&#151;<B>strlen</B> calls, parameter pushing, calling, setup, and all&#151;the version of <B>FindString</B> in Listing 9.2, which is directed by Listing 9.3 to scan for the infrequently-occurring &#147;Q,&#148; is about 40 percent faster on a 20 MHz cached 386 for the test search of Listing 9.3 than is the version of <B>FindString</B> in Listing 9.1, which always scans for the first character, in this case &#147;E.&#148; However, when only the search loops (the code that actually does the searching) in the two versions of <B>FindString</B> are compared, Listing 9.2 is more than <I>twice</I> as fast as Listing 9.1&#151;a remarkable improvement over code that already uses <B>REPNZ SCASB</B> and <B>REPZ CMPS</B>.</P>
<P>What I like so much about Rob&#146;s approach is that it demonstrates that optimization involves much more than instruction selection and cycle counting. Listings 9.1 and 9.2 use pretty much the same instructions, and even use the same approach of scanning with <B>REPNZ SCASB</B> and using <B>REPZ CMPS</B> to check scanning matches.</P>

; Searches a text buffer for a text string. Uses REPNZ SCASB to sca"n
; the buffer for locations that match the first character of the
; searched-for string, then uses REPZ CMPS to check fully only those
; locations that REPNZ SCASB has identified as potential matches.

; Adapted from Zen of Assembly Language, by Michael Abrash
;
; C small model-callable as:
;    unsigned char * FindString(unsigned char * Buffer,
;     unsigned int BufferLength, unsigned char * SearchString,
;     unsigned int SearchStringLength);
;
; Returns a pointer to the first match for SearchString in Buffer,or
; a NULL pointer if no match is found. Buffer should not start at
; offset 0 in the data segment to avoid confusing a match at 0 with
; no match found.
