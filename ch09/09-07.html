<P>Next, we come to an item that cycle counters will love, especially since it involves apparently incorrect documentation on Intel&#146;s part. According to Intel&#146;s documents, all <B>RCR</B> and <B>RCL</B> instructions, which perform rotations through the Carry flag, as shown in Figure 9.4, take 9 cycles on the 386 when working with a register operand. My measurements indicate that the 9-cycle execution time almost holds true for <I>multibit</I> rotate-through-carries, which I&#146;ve timed at 8 cycles apiece; for example, <B>RCR AX,CL</B> takes 8 cycles on <I>my</I> 386, as does <B>RCL DX,2</B>. Contrast that with <B>ROR</B> and <B>ROL</B>, which can rotate the contents of a register any number of bits in just 3 cycles.</P>
<P>However, rotating by one bit through the Carry flag does <I>not</I> take 9 cycles, contrary to Intel&#146;s <I>80386 Programmer&#146;s Reference Manual</I>, or even 8 cycles. In fact, <B>RCR</B> <I>reg</I>,1 and <B>RCL</B> <I>reg</I>,1 take 3 cycles, just like <B>ROR, ROL, SHR,</B> and <B>SHL</B>. At least, that&#146;s how fast they run on my 386, and I very much doubt that you&#146;ll find different execution times on other 386s. (Please let me know if you do, though!)</P>

</P>
<P>Interestingly, according to Intel&#146;s <I>i486 Microprocessor Programmer&#146;s Reference Manual</I>, the 486 can <B>RCR</B> or <B>RCL</B> a register by one bit in 3 cycles, but takes between 8 and 30 cycles to perform a multibit register <B>RCR</B> or <B>RCL</B>!</P>
<P>No great lesson here, just a caution to be leery of multibit <B>RCR</B> and <B>RCL</B> when performance matters&#151;and to take cycle-time documentation with a grain of salt.</P>
<H4 ALIGN="LEFT"><A NAME="Heading11"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">Hardwired Far Jumps</FONT></H4>
<P>Did you ever wonder how to code a far jump to an absolute address in assembly language? Probably not, but if you ever do, you&#146;re going to be glad for this next item, because the obvious solution doesn&#146;t work. You might think all it would take to jump to, say, 1000:5 would be <B>JMP FAR PTR 1000:5</B>, but you&#146;d be wrong. That won&#146;t even assemble. You might then think to construct in memory a far pointer containing 1000:5, as in the following:</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<PRE>
Ptr  dd   ?
     :
     mov  word ptr [Ptr],5
     mov  word ptr [Ptr&#43;2],1000h
     jmp  [Ptr]
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<P>That will work, but at a price in performance. On an 8088, <B>JMP DWORD PTR [<I>mem</I>]</B> (an indirect far jump) takes at least 37 cycles; <B>JMP DWORD PTR <I>label</I></B> (a direct far jump) takes only 15 cycles (plus, almost certainly, some cycles for instruction fetching). On a 386, an indirect far jump is documented to take at least 43 cycles in real mode (31 in protected mode); a direct far jump is documented to take at least 12 cycles, about three times faster. In truth, the difference between those two is nowhere near that big; the fastest I&#146;ve measured for a direct far jump is 21 cycles, and I&#146;ve measured indirect far jumps as fast as 30 cycles, so direct is still faster, but not by so much. (Oh, those cycle-time documentation blues!) Also, a direct far jump is documented to take at least 27 cycles in protected mode; why the big difference in protected mode, I have no idea.</P>
<P>At any rate, to return to our original problem of jumping to 1000:5: Although an indirect far jump will work, a direct far jump is still preferable.</P>
<P>Listing 9.7 shows a short program that performs a direct far call to 1000:5. (Don&#146;t run it, unless you want to crash your system!) It does this by creating a dummy segment at 1000H, so that the label <B>FarLabel</B> can be created with the desired far attribute at the proper location. (Segments created with &#147;AT&#148; don&#146;t cause the generation of any actual bytes or the allocation of any memory; they&#146;re just templates.) It&#146;s a little kludgey, but at least it does work. There may be a better solution; if you have one, pass it along.</P>
<P><B>LISTING 9.7 L9-7.ASM</B></P>
<!-- CODE //-->
<PRE>
; Program to perform a direct far jump to address 1000:5.
; *** Do not run this program! It&#146;s just an example of how ***

      .code

      jmp     FarLabel
      end     start
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE //-->
<P>By the way, if you&#146;re wondering how I figured this out, I merely applied my good friend Dan Illowsky&#146;s long-standing rule for dealing with MASM:
</P>
<P>If the obvious doesn&#146;t work (and it usually doesn&#146;t), just try everything you can think of, no matter how ridiculous, until you find something that does&#151;a rule with plenty of history on its side.</P>
<H4 ALIGN="LEFT"><A NAME="Heading12"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">Setting 32-Bit Registers: Time versus Space</FONT></H4>
<P>To finish up this chapter, consider these two items. First, in 32-bit protected mode,
</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<PRE>
sub  eax,eax
inc  eax
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<P>takes 4 cycles to execute, but is only 3 bytes long, while
</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<PRE>
mov  eax,1
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<P>takes only 2 cycles to execute, but is 5 bytes long (because native mode constants are dwords and the <B>MOV</B> instruction doesn&#146;t sign-extend). Both code fragments are ways to set <B>EAX</B> to 1 (although the first affects the flags and the second doesn&#146;t); this is a classic trade-off of speed for space. Second,</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<PRE>
or    ebx,-1
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<P>takes 2 cycles to execute and is 3 bytes long, while
</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<PRE>
move  bx,-1
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<P>takes 2 cycles to execute and is 5 bytes long. Both instructions set <B>EBX</B> to -1; this is a classic trade-off of&#151;gee, it&#146;s not a trade-off at all, is it? <B>OR</B> is a better way to set a 32-bit register to all 1-bits, just as <B>SUB</B> or <B>XOR</B> is a better way to set a register to all 0-bits. Who woulda thunk it? Just goes to show how the 32-bit displacements and constants of 386 native mode change the familiar landscape of 80&#215;86 optimization.</P>
<P>Be warned, though, that I&#146;ve found <B>OR, AND, ADD</B>, and the like to be a cycle slower than <B>MOV</B> when working with immediate operands on the 386 under some circumstances, for reasons that thus far escape me. This just reinforces the first rule of optimization: Measure your code in action, and place not your trust in documented cycle times.</P><P><BR></P>
