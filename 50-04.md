The other 2-D element we need is some way to erase the polygon at its
old location before it's moved and redrawn. We'll do that by remembering
the bounding rectangle of the polygon each time it's drawn, then erasing
by clearing that area with a rectangle fill.

With the 2-D side of the picture well under control, we're ready to
concentrate on the good stuff. Listings 50.2 through 50.5 are the sample
3-D animation program. Listing 50.2 provides matrix multiplication
functions in a straightforward fashion. Listing 50.3 transforms,
projects, and draws polygons. Listing 50.4 is the general header file
for the program, and Listing 50.5 is the main animation program.

Other modules required are: Listings 47.1 and 47.6 from Chapter 47 (Mode
X mode set, rectangle fill); Listing 49.6 from Chapter 49; Listing 39.4
from Chapter 39 (polygon edge scan); and the **FillConvexPolygon()**
function from Listing 38.1 in Chapter 38. All necessary code modules,
along with a project file, are present in the subdirectory for this
chapter on the listings disk, whether they were presented in this
chapter or some earlier chapter. This will be the case for the next
several chapters as well, where listings from previous chapters are
referenced. This scheme may crowd the listings diskette a little bit,
but it will certainly reduce confusion!
