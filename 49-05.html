<P>Here&#146;s something worth noting: The animation is extremely smooth on a 20 MHz 386. It is somewhat more jerky on an 8 MHz 286, because only 30 frames a second can be processed. If animation looks jerky on your PC, try reducing the number of kites.
</P>
<P>The kites draw perfectly into the background, with no interference or fringe, thanks to masked copying. In fact, the kites also cross with no interference (the last-drawn kite is always in front), although that&#146;s not readily apparent because they all look the same anyway and are moving fast. Listing 49.5 isn&#146;t inherently limited to kites; create your own images and initialize the object list to display a mix of those images and see the full power of Mode X animation.</P>
<P>The external functions called by Listing 49.5 can be found in Listings 49.1, 49.2, 49.3, and 49.6, and in the listings for the previous two chapters.</P>

<P>We now end our exploration of Mode X, although we&#146;ll use it again shortly for 3-D animation. Mode X admittedly has its complexities; that&#146;s why I&#146;ve provided a broad and flexible primitive set. Still, so what if it <I>is</I> complex? Take a look at Listing 49.5 in action. That sort of colorful, high-performance animation is worth jumping through a few hoops for; drawing 20, or even 10, fair-sized objects at a rate of 60 Hz, with no flicker, interference, or fringe, is no mean accomplishment, even on a 386.</P>
<P>There&#146;s much more we could do with animation in general and with Mode X in particular, but it&#146;s time to move on to new challenges. In closing, I&#146;d like to point out that all of the VGA&#146;s hardware features, including the built-in AND, OR, and XOR functions, are available in Mode X, just as they are in the standard VGA modes. If you understand the VGA&#146;s hardware in mode 12H, try applying that knowledge to Mode X; you might be surprised at what you find you can do.</P><P><BR></P>
