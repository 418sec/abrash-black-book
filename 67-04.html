<P>By the same token, Listing 67.1 is quite a bit more complicated than the earlier code. The earlier code&rsquo;s HSR consisted of a z-sort of objects, followed by the drawing of the objects in back-to-front order, one polygon at a time. Apart from the simple object sorter, all that was needed was backface culling and a polygon rasterizer.
</P>
<P>Listing 67.1 replaces this simple pipeline with a three-stage HSR process. After backface culling, the edges of each of the polygons in the scene are added to the global edge list, by way of <B>AddPolygonEdges()</B>. After all edges have been added, the edges are turned into spans by <B>ScanEdges()</B>, with each pixel on the screen being covered by one and only one span (that is, there&rsquo;s no overdraw). Once all the spans have been generated, they&rsquo;re drawn by <B>DrawSpans()</B>, and rasterization is complete.</P>
<P>There&rsquo;s nothing tricky about <B>AddPolygonEdges()</B>, and <B>DrawSpans()</B>, as implemented in Listing 67.1, is very straightforward as well. In an implementation that supported texture mapping, however, all the spans wouldn&rsquo;t be put on one global span list and drawn at once, as is done in Listing 67.1, because that would result in drawing spans from all the surfaces in no particular order. (A surface is a drawing object that&rsquo;s originally described by a polygon, but in <B>ScanEdges()</B> there is no polygon in the classic sense of a set of vertices bounding an area, but rather just a set of edges and a surface that describes how to draw the spans outlined by those edges.) That would mean constantly skipping from one texture to another, which in turn would hurt processor cache coherency a great deal, and would also incur considerable overhead in setting up gradient and perspective calculations each time a surface was drawn. In Quake, we have a linked list of spans hanging off each surface, and draw all the spans for one surface before moving on to the next surface.</P>
<P>The core of Listing 67.1, and the most complex aspect of 1/z-sorted spans, is <B>ScanEdges()</B>, where the global edge list is converted into a set of spans describing the nearest surface at each pixel. This process is actually pretty simple, though, if you think of it as follows:</P>
<P>For each scan line, there is a set of active edges, which are those edges that intersect the scan line. A good part of <B>ScanEdges()</B> is dedicated to adding any edges that first appear on the current scan line (scan lines are processed from the top scan line on the screen to the bottom), removing edges that reach their bottom on the current scan line, and x-sorting the active edges so that the active edges for the next scan can be processed from left to right. All this is per-scan-line maintenance, and is basically just linked list insertion, deletion, and sorting.</P>
<P>The heart of the action is the loop in <B>ScanEdges()</B> that processes the edges on the current scan line from left to right, generating spans as needed. The best way to think of this loop is as a surface event processor, where each edge is an event with an associated surface. Each leading edge is an event marking the start of its surface on that scan line; if the surface is nearer than the current nearest surface, then a span ends for the nearest surface, and a span starts for the new surface. Each trailing edge is an event marking the end of its surface; if its surface is currently nearest, then a span ends for that surface, and a span starts for the next-nearest surface (the surface with the next-largest 1/z at the coordinate where the edge intersects the scan line). One handy aspect of this event-oriented processing is that leading and trailing edges do not need to be explicitly paired, because they are implicitly paired by pointing to the same surface. This saves the memory and time that would otherwise be needed to track edge pairs.</P>
<P>One more element is required in order for <B>ScanEdges()</B> to work efficiently. Each time a leading or trailing edge occurs, it must be determined whether its surface is nearest (at a larger 1/z value than any currently active surface). In addition, for leading edges, the currently topmost surface must be known, and for trailing edges, it may be necessary to know the currently next-to-topmost surface. The easiest way to accomplish this is with a <I>surface stack</I>; that is, a linked list of all currently active surfaces, starting with the nearest surface and progressing toward the farthest surface, which, as described below, is always the background surface. (The operation of this sort of edge event-based stack was described and illustrated in Chapter 66.) Each leading edge causes its surface to be 1/z-sorted into the surface stack, with a span emitted if necessary. Each trailing edge causes its surface to be removed from the surface stack, again with a span emitted if necessary. As you can see from Listing 67.1, it takes a fair bit of code to implement this, but all that&rsquo;s really going on is a surface stack driven by edge events.</P><P><BR></P>
