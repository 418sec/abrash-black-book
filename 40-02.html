  <p>Advancing the X coordinates is easy. For each edge, we&rsquo;ll store the current X coordinate and all required error term information, and we&rsquo;ll use that to advance the edge one scan line at a time; then, we&rsquo;ll resort the AET by X coordinate as needed. Removing edges as they end is also easy; we&rsquo;ll just count down the length of each active edge on each scan line and remove an edge when its count reaches zero. Adding edges as their tops are encountered is a tad more complex. While there are a number of ways to do this, one particularly efficient approach is to start out by putting all the edges of the polygon, sorted by increasing Y coordinate, into a single list, called the <i>global edge table</i> (GET). Then, as each scan line is encountered, all edges at the start of the GET that begin on the current scan line are moved to the AET; because the GET is Y-sorted, there&rsquo;s no need to search the entire GET. For still greater efficiency, edges in the GET that share common Y coordinates can be sorted by increasing X coordinate; this ensures that no more than one pass through the AET per scan line is ever needed when adding new edges from the GET in such a way as to keep the AET sorted in ascending X order.</p>

  <p>What form should the GET and AET take? Linked lists of edge structures, as shown in Figure 40.3. With linked lists, all that&rsquo;s required to move edges from the GET to the AET as they become active, sort the AET, and remove edges that have been fully drawn is the exchanging of a few pointers.</p>

  <p>In summary, we&rsquo;ll initially store all the polygon edges in Y-primary/X-secondary sort order in the GET, complete with initial X and Y coordinates, error terms and error term adjustments, lengths, and directions of X movement for each edge. Once the GET is built, we&rsquo;ll do the following:</p>

  <dl>
    <dd><b>1.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Set the current Y coordinate to the Y coordinate of the first edge in the GET.</dd>

    <dd><b>2.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Move all edges with the current Y coordinate from the GET to the AET, removing them from the GET and maintaining the X-sorted order of the AET.</dd>

    <dd><b>3.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Draw all odd-to-even spans in the AET at the current Y coordinate.</dd>

    <dd><b>4.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Count down the lengths of all edges in the AET, removing any edges that are done, and advancing the X coordinates of all remaining edges in the AET by one scan line.</dd>

    <dd><b>5.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sort the AET in order of ascending X coordinate.</dd>

    <dd><b>6.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Advance the current Y coordinate by one scan line.</dd>

    <dd><b>7.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;If either the AET or GET isn&rsquo;t empty, go to step 2.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>That&rsquo;s really all there is to it. Compare Listing 40.1 to the fast convex polygon filling code from Chapter 39, and you&rsquo;ll see that, contrary to expectation, complex polygon filling is indeed one of the more sane and sensible corners of the universe.</p>

  <p><b>LISTING 40.1 L40-1.C</b></p>
  <pre>
 /* Color-fills an arbitrarily-shaped polygon described by VertexList.
    If the first and last points in VertexList are not the same, the path
    around the polygon is automatically closed. All vertices are offset
    by (XOffset, YOffset). Returns 1 for success, 0 if memory allocation
    failed. All C code tested with Borland C++.
    If the polygon shape is known in advance, speedier processing may be
    enabled by specifying the shape as follows: &ldquo;convex&rdquo; - a rubber band
    stretched around the polygon would touch every vertex in order;
    &ldquo;nonconvex&rdquo; - the polygon is not self-intersecting, but need not be
    convex; &ldquo;complex&rdquo; - the polygon may be self-intersecting, or, indeed,
    any sort of polygon at all. Complex will work for all polygons; convex
    is fastest. Undefined results will occur if convex is specified for a
    nonconvex or complex polygon.
    Define CONVEX_CODE_LINKED if the fast convex polygon filling code from
    Chapter 38 is linked in. Otherwise, convex polygons are
    handled by the complex polygon filling code.
    Nonconvex is handled as complex in this implementation. See text for a
    discussion of faster nonconvex handling. */
