<P>From the beginning, Quake was conceived as a client-server app, specifically so that it would be possible to have persistent servers always running on the Internet, independent of whether anyone was playing on them at any particular time, as a step toward the long-term goal of persistent worlds. Also, client-server architectures tend to be more flexible and robust than peer-to-peer, and it is much easier to have players come and go at will with client-server. Quake is client-server from the ground up, and even in single-player mode, messages are passed through buffers between the client code and the server code; it&rsquo;s quite likely that the client and server would have been two processes, in fact, were it not for the need to support DOS. Client-server turned out to be the right decision, because Quake&rsquo;s ability to support persistent, come-and-go-as-you-please Internet servers with up to 16 people has been instrumental in the game&rsquo;s high visibility in the press, and its lasting popularity.
</P>
<P>However, client-server is not without a cost, because, in its pure form, latency for clients consists of the round trip from the client to the server and back. (In Quake, orientation changes instantly on the client, short-circuiting the trip to the server, but all other events, such as motion and firing, must make the round trip before they happen on the client.) In peer-to-peer games, maximum latency can be just the cost of the one-way trip, because each client is running a simulation of the game, and each peer sees its own actions instantly. What all this means is that latency is the downside of client-server, but in many other respects client-server is very attractive. So the big task with client-server is to reduce latency.</P>
<P>As of the release of QTest1, the first and last prerelease of Quake, John had smoothed net play considerably by actually keeping the client&rsquo;s virtual time a bit earlier than the time of the last server packet, and interpolating events between the last two packets to the client&rsquo;s virtual time. This meant that events didn&rsquo;t snap to whatever packet had arrived last, and got rid of considerable jerking and stuttering. Unfortunately, it actually increased latency, because of the retarding of time needed to make the interpolation possible. This illustrates a common tradeoff, which is that reduced latency often makes for rougher play.</P>
<TABLE WIDTH="100%"><TD WIDTH="5%" VALIGN="TOP"><IMG SRC="images/i.jpg"><TD WIDTH="95%"><SMALL><I>Reduced latency also often makes for more frustrating play. It&rsquo;s actually not hard to reduce the latency perceived by the player, but many of the approaches that reduce latency introduce the potential for paradoxes that can be quite distracting and annoying. For example, a player may see a rocket go by, and think they&rsquo;ve dodged it, only to find themselves exploding a second later as the difference of opinion between his simulation and the other simulation is resolved to his detriment.</I></SMALL>
</TABLE>
<P>Worse, QTest1 was prone to frequent hitching over all but the best connections, because it was built around reliable packet delivery (TCP) provided by the operating system. Whenever a packet didn&rsquo;t arrive, there was a long pause waiting for the retransmission. After QTest1, John realized that this was a fundamentally wrong assumption, and changed the code to use unreliable packet delivery (UDP), sending the relevant portion of the full state every time (possible only because the PVS can be used to cull most events in a level), and letting the game logic itself deal with packets that didn&rsquo;t arrive. A reliable sideband was used as well, but only for events like scores, not for gameplay state. However, this was a good example of Carmack&rsquo;s Law: John did not rewrite the net code to reflect this new fundamental assumption, and wound up with 8,000 lines of messy code that took right up until Quake shipped to debug. For QuakeWorld, John did rewrite the net code from scratch around the assumption of unreliable packet delivery, and it wound up as just 1,500 lines of clean, bug-free code.
</P>
<P>In the long run, it&rsquo;s cheaper to rewrite than to patch and modify!</P>
<P>So as of shipping Quake, multiplayer performance was quite smooth, but latency was still a major issue, often in the 250 to 400 ms range for modem players. QuakeWorld attacked this in two ways. First, it reduced latency by around 50 to 100 ms with a server change. The Quake server runs 10 or 20 times a second, batching up inputs in between ticks, and sending out results after the tick. By contrast, QuakeWorld servers run immediately whenever a client sends input, knocking up to 50 or 100 ms off response time, although at the cost of a greater server processing load. (A similar anti-latency idea that wasn&rsquo;t implemented in QuakeWorld is having a separate thread that can send input off to the server as soon as it happens, instead of incurring up to a frame of latency.)</P>
<P>The second way in which QuakeWorld attacks latency is by not interpolating. The player is actually predicted well ahead of the latest server packet (after all, the client has all the information needed to move the player, unless an outside force intervenes), giving very responsive control. The rest of the world is drawn as of the latest server packet; this is jerkier than Quake, again showing that smoothness is often a tradeoff for latency. The player&rsquo;s prediction may, of course, result in a minor paradox; for example, if an explosion turns out to have knocked the player sideways, the player&rsquo;s location may suddenly jump without warning as the server packet arrives with the correct location. In the latest version of QuakeWorld, the other players are predicted as well, with consequently more frequent paradoxes, but smoother, more convincing motion. Platforms and doors are still not predicted, and consequently are still pretty jerky. It is, of course, possible to predict more and more objects into the future; it&rsquo;s a tradeoff of smoothness and perceived low latency for the frustration of paradoxes&mdash;and that&rsquo;s the way it&rsquo;s going to stay until most people are connected to the Internet by something better than modems.</P>
<H4 ALIGN="LEFT"><A NAME="Heading20"></A>Quake 2</H4>
<P>I can&rsquo;t talk in detail about Quake 2 as a game, but I can describe some interesting technology features. The Quake 2 rendering engine isn&rsquo;t going to change that much from Quake; the improvements are largely in areas such as physics, gameplay, artwork, and overall design. The most interesting graphics change is in the preprocessing, where John has added support for radiosity lighting; that is, the ability to put a light source into the world and have the light bounced around the world realistically. This is sometimes terrific&mdash;it makes for great glowing light around lava and hanging light panels&mdash;but in other cases it&rsquo;s less spectacular than the effects that designers can get by placing lots of direct-illumination light sources in a room, so the two methods can be used as needed. Also, radiosity is <I>very</I> computationally expensive, approximately as expensive as BSPing. Most of the radiosity demos I&rsquo;ve seen have been in one or two rooms, and the order of the problem goes up tremendously on whole Quake levels. Here&rsquo;s another case where the PVS is essential; without it, radiosity processing time would be O(polygons<SUP>2</SUP>), but with the PVS it&rsquo;s O(polygons*average_potentially_visible_polygons), which is over an order of magnitude less (and increases approximately linearly, rather than as a squared function, with greater-level complexity).</P><P><BR></P>
