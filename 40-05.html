  <p>An insertion sort that scans backward through the AET from the current edge rather than forward from the start of the AET could be quite a bit faster, because edges rarely move more than one or two positions through the AET. However, scanning backward requires a doubly linked list, rather than the singly linked list used in Listing 40.1. I&rsquo;ve chosen to use a singly linked list partly to minimize memory requirements (double-linking requires an extra pointer field) and partly because supporting back links would complicate the code a good bit. The main reason, though, is that the potential rewards for the complications of back links and insertion sorting aren&rsquo;t great enough; profiling a variety of polygons reveals that less than ten percent of total time is spent sorting the AET.</p>

  <h3 id="Heading8">Nonconvex Polygons</h3>

  <p>Nonconvex polygons can be filled somewhat faster than complex polygons. Because edges never cross or switch positions with other edges once they&rsquo;re in the AET, the AET for a nonconvex polygon needs to be sorted only when new edges are added. In order for this to work, though, edges must be added to the AET in strict left-to-right order. Complications arise when dealing with two edges that start at the same point, because slopes must be compared to determine which edge is leftmost. This is certainly doable, but because of space limitations and limited performance returns, I haven&rsquo;t implemented this in Listing 40.1.</p>

  <h4 align="left" id="Heading9">Details, Details</h4>

  <p>Every so often, a programming demon that I&rsquo;d thought I&rsquo;d forever laid to rest arises to haunt me once again. A minor example of this&mdash;an imp, if you will&mdash;is the use of &ldquo; = &rdquo; when I mean &ldquo; == ,&rdquo; which I&rsquo;ve done all too often in the past, and am sure I&rsquo;ll do again. That&rsquo;s minor deviltry, though, compared to the considerably greater evils of one of my personal scourges, of which I was recently reminded anew: too-close attention to detail. Not seeing the forest for the trees. Looking low when I should have looked high. Missing the big picture, if you catch my drift.</p>

  <p>Thoreau said it best: &ldquo;Our life is frittered away by detail....Simplify, simplify.&rdquo; That quote sprang to mind when I received a letter a while back from Anton Treuenfels of Fridley, Minnesota, thanking me for clarifying the principles of filling adjacent convex polygons in my ongoing writings on graphics programming. (You&rsquo;ll find this material in the previous two chapters.) Anton then went on to describe his own method for filling convex polygons.</p>

  <p>Anton&rsquo;s approach had its virtues and drawbacks, foremost among the virtues being a simplicity Thoreau would have admired. For instance, in writing my polygon-filling code, I had spent quite some time trying to figure out the best way to identify which edge was the left edge and which the right, finally settling on comparing the slopes of the edges if the top of the polygon wasn&rsquo;t flat, and comparing the starting points of the edges if the top was flat. Anton simplified this tremendously by not bothering to figure out ahead of time which was the right edge of the polygon and which the left, instead scanning out the two edges in whatever order he found them and letting the low-level drawing code test, and if necessary swap, the endpoints of each horizontal line of the fill, so that filling started at the leftmost edge. This is a little slower than my approach (although the difference is almost surely negligible), but it also makes quite a bit of code go away.</p>

  <p>What that example, and others like it in Anton&rsquo;s letter, did was kick my mind into a mode that it hadn&rsquo;t&mdash;but should have&mdash;been in when I wrote the code, a mode in which I began to wonder, &ldquo;How else can I simplify this code?&rdquo;; what you might call Occam&rsquo;s Razor mode. You see, I created the convex polygon-drawing code by first writing pseudocode, then writing C code, and finally writing assembly code, and once the pseudocode was finished, I stopped thinking about the interactions of the various portions of the program.</p>

  <p>In other words, I became so absorbed in individual details that I forgot to consider the code as a whole. That was a mistake, and an embarrassing one for someone who constantly preaches that programmers should look at their code from a variety of perspectives; the next chapter shows just how much difference thinking about the big picture can make. May my embarrassment be your enlightenment.</p>

  <p>The point is not whether, in the final analysis, my code or Anton&rsquo;s code is better; both have their advantages. The point is that I was programming with half a deck because I was so fixated on the details of a single type of implementation; I ended up with relatively hard-to-write, complex code, and missed out on many potentially useful optimizations by being so focused. It&rsquo;s a big world out there, and there are many subtle approaches to any problem, so relax and keep the big picture in mind as you implement your programs. Your code will likely be not only better, but also simpler. And whenever you see me walking across hot coals in this book or elsewhere when there&rsquo;s an easier way to go, please, let me know!</p>

  <p>Thanks, Anton.</p>
