And indeed it does. When the test program is modified to draw to a local
buffer, both the C and assembly language versions get 0.29 seconds
faster, that being a measure of the time taken by display memory wait
states. With those wait states factored out, the assembly language
version of `DrawHorizontalLineList` becomes almost three times as fast
as the C code.

#### Maximizing REP STOS {#Heading7}

Listing 39.3 doesn't take the easy way out and use `REP STOSB` to fill
each scan line; instead, it uses `REP STOSW` to fill as many pixel
pairs as possible via word-sized accesses, using `STOSB` only to do
odd bytes. Word accesses to odd addresses are always split by the
processor into 2-byte accesses. Such word accesses take twice as long as
word accesses to even addresses, so Listing 39.3 makes sure that all
word accesses occur at even addresses, by performing a leading `STOSB`
first if necessary.

Listing 39.3 is another case in which it's worth knowing the environment
in which your code will run. Extra code is required to perform aligned
word-at-a-time filling, resulting in extra overhead. For very small or
narrow polygons, that overhead might overwhelm the advantage of drawing
a word at a time, making plain old `REP STOSB` faster.

### Faster Edge Tracing {#Heading8}

Finally, Listing 39.4 is an assembly language version of `ScanEdge`.
Listing 39.4 is a relatively straightforward translation from C to
assembly, but is nonetheless about twice as fast as Listing 39.2.

The version of `ScanEdge` in Listing 39.4 could certainly be sped up
still further by unrolling the loops. `FillConvexPolygon`, the overall
coordination routine, hasn't even been converted to assembly language,
so that could be sped up as well. I haven't bothered with these
optimizations because all code other than `DrawHorizontalLineList`
takes only 14 percent of the overall polygon filling time when drawing
to display memory; the potential return on optimizing nondrawing code
simply isn't great enough to justify the effort. Part of the value of a
profiler is being able to tell when to stop optimizing; with Listings
39.3 and 39.4 in use, more than two-thirds of the time taken to draw
polygons is spent waiting for display memory, so optimization is pretty
much maxed out. However, further optimization might be worthwhile when
drawing to system memory, where wait states are out of the picture and
the nondrawing code takes a significant portion (46 percent) of the
overall time.

Again, *know where the cycles go* .

By the way, note that all the versions of `ScanEdge` and
`FillConvexPolygon` that we've looked at are adapter-independent, and
that the C code is also machine-independent; all adapter-specific code
is isolated in `DrawHorizontalLineList`. This makes it easy to add
support for other graphics systems, such as the 8514/A, the XGA, or, for
that matter, a completely non-PC system.
