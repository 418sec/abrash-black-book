<H4 ALIGN="LEFT"><A NAME="Heading9"></A>Setting the DAC</H4>
<P>Like the palette RAM, the DAC registers can be set either directly or through the BIOS. Again, the BIOS should be used whenever possible, but there are a few complications here. My experience is that varying degrees of flicker and screen bounce occur on many VGAs when a large block of DAC registers is set through the BIOS. That&rsquo;s not a problem when the DAC is loaded just once and then left that way, as is the case in Listing 33.1, which we&rsquo;ll get to shortly, but it can be a serious problem when the color set is changed rapidly (&ldquo;cycled&rdquo;) to produce on-screen effects such as rippling colors. My (limited) experience is that it&rsquo;s necessary to program the DAC directly in order to cycle colors cleanly, although input from readers who have worked extensively with VGA color is welcome.
</P>
<P>At any rate, the code in this chapter will use the BIOS to set the DAC, so I&rsquo;ll describe the BIOS DAC-setting functions next. Later, I&rsquo;ll briefly describe how to set both the palette RAM and DAC registers directly, and I&rsquo;ll return to the topic in detail in an upcoming chapter when we discuss color cycling.</P>
<P>An individual DAC register can be set by interrupt 10H, function 10H (AH=10), subfunction 10H (AL=10H), with BX indicating the register to be set and the color to which that register is to be set stored in DH (6-bit red component), CH (6-bit green component), and CL (6-bit blue component).</P>
<P>A block of sequential DAC registers ranging in size from one register up to all 256 can be set via subfunction 12H (AL=12H) of interrupt 10H, function 10H (AH=10H). In this case, BX contains the number of the first register to set, CX contains the number of registers to set, and ES:DX contains the address of a table of color entries to which DAC registers BX through BX+CX-1 are to be set. The color entry for each DAC register consists of three bytes; the first byte is a 6-bit red component, the second byte is a 6-bit green component, and the third byte is a 6-bit blue component, as illustrated by Listing 33.1.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading10"></A>If You Can&rsquo;t Call the BIOS, Who Ya Gonna Call?</H3>
<P>Although the palette RAM and DAC registers should be set through the BIOS whenever possible, there are times when the BIOS is not the best choice or even a choice at all; for example, a protected-mode program may not have access to the BIOS. Also, as mentioned earlier, it may be necessary to program the DAC directly when performing color cycling. Therefore, I&rsquo;ll briefly describe how to set the palette RAM and DAC registers directly; in Chapter A on the companion CD-ROM I&rsquo;ll discuss programming the DAC directly in more detail.
</P>
<P>The palette RAM registers are Attribute Controller registers 0 through 15. They are set by first reading the Input Status 1 register (at 3DAH in color mode or 3BAH in monochrome mode) to reset the Attribute Controller toggle to index mode, then loading the Attribute Controller Index register (at 3C0H) with the number (0 through 15) of the register to be loaded. Do <I>not</I> set bit 5 of the Index register to 1, as you normally would, but rather set bit 5 to 0. Setting bit 5 to 0 allows values to be written to the palette RAM registers, but it also causes the screen to blank, so you should wait for the start of vertical retrace before loading palette RAM registers if you don&rsquo;t want the screen to flicker. (Do you see why it&rsquo;s easier to go through the BIOS?) Then, write the desired register value to 3C0H, which has now toggled to become the Attribute Controller Data register. Write any desired number of additional register number/register data pairs to 3C0H, then write 20H to 3C0H to unblank the screen.</P>
<P>The process of loading the palette RAM registers depends heavily on the proper sequence being followed; if the Attribute Controller Index register or index/data toggle data gets changed in the middle of the loading process, you&rsquo;ll probably end up with a hideous display, or no display at all. Consequently, for maximum safety you may want to disable interrupts while you load the palette RAM, to prevent any sort of interference from a TSR or the like that alters the state of the Attribute Controller in the middle of the loading sequence.</P>
<P>The DAC registers are set by writing the number of the first register to set to the DAC Write Index register at 3C8H, then writing three bytes&mdash;the 6-bit red component, the 6-bit green component, and the 6-bit blue component, in that order&mdash;to the DAC Data register at 3C9H. The DAC Write Index register then autoincrements, so if you write another three-byte RGB value to the DAC Data register, it&rsquo;ll go to the next DAC register, and so on indefinitely; you can set all 256 registers by sending 256*3 = 768 bytes to the DAC Data Register.</P>
<P>Loading the DAC is just as sequence-dependent and potentially susceptible to interference as is loading the palette, so my personal inclination is to go through the whole process of disabling interrupts, loading the DAC Write Index, and writing a three-byte RGB value separately for each DAC register; although that doesn&rsquo;t take advantage of the autoincrementing feature, it seems to me to be least susceptible to outside influences. (It would be even better to disable interrupts for the entire duration of DAC register loading, but that&rsquo;s much too long a time to leave interrupts off.) However, I have no hard evidence to offer in support of my conservative approach to setting the DAC, just an uneasy feeling, so I&rsquo;d be most interested in hearing from any readers.</P>
<P>A final point is that the process of loading both the palette RAM and DAC registers involves performing multiple <B>OUT</B>s to the same register. Many people whose opinions I respect recommend delaying between I/O accesses to the same port by performing a <B>JMP $+2</B> (jumping flushes the prefetch queue and forces a memory access&mdash;or at least a cache access&mdash;to fetch the next instruction byte). In fact, some people recommend two <B>JMP $+2</B> instructions between I/O accesses to the same port, and <I>three</I> jumps between I/O accesses to the same port that go in opposite directions (<B>OUT</B> followed by <B>IN</B> or <B>IN</B> followed by <B>OUT</B>). This is clearly necessary when accessing some motherboard chips, but I don&rsquo;t know how applicable it is when accessing VGAs, so make of it what you will. Input from knowledgeable readers is eagerly solicited.</P>
<P>In the meantime, if you can use the BIOS to set the DAC, do so; then you won&rsquo;t have to worry about the real and potential complications of setting the DAC directly.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading11"></A>An Example of Setting the DAC</H3>
<P>This chapter has gotten about as big as a chapter really ought to be; the VGA color saga will continue in the next few. Quickly, then, Listing 33.1 is a simple example of setting the DAC that gives you a taste of the spectacular effects that color translation makes possible. There&rsquo;s nothing particularly complex about Listing 33.1; it just selects 256-color mode, fills the screen with one-pixel-wide concentric diamonds drawn with sequential attributes, and sets the DAC to produce a smooth gradient of each of the three primary colors and of a mix of red and blue. Run the program; I suspect you&rsquo;ll be surprised at the stunning display this short program produces. Clever color manipulation is perhaps the easiest way to produce truly eye-catching effects on the PC.
