<P>The last section contained a particularly interesting phrase: <I>the time-critical portions of your code</I>. Time-critical portions of your code are those portions in which the speed of the code makes a significant difference in the overall performance of your program&#151;and by &#147;significant,&#148; I don&#146;t mean that it makes the code 100 percent faster, or 200 percent, or any particular amount at all, but rather that it makes the program more responsive and/or usable <I>from the user&#146;s perspective</I>.</P>
<P>Don&#146;t waste time optimizing non-time-critical code: set-up code, initialization code, and the like. Spend your time improving the performance of the code inside heavily-used loops and in the portions of your programs that directly affect response time. Notice, for example, that I haven&#146;t bothered to implement a version of the checksum program entirely in assembly; Listings 1.2 and 1.6 call assembly subroutines that handle the time-critical operations, but C is still used for checking command-line parameters, operning files, printing, and the like.</P>
<TABLE WIDTH="100%"><TD WIDTH="5%" VALIGN="TOP"><IMG SRC="images/i.jpg"><TD WIDTH="95%"><SMALL><I>If you were to implement any of the listings in this chapter entirely in hand-optimized assembly, I suppose you might get a performance improvement of a few percent&#151;but I rather doubt you&#146;d get even that much, and you&#146;d sure as heck spend an awful lot of time for whatever meager improvement does result. Let C do what it does well, and use assembly only when it makes a perceptible difference.</I></SMALL>
</TABLE>
<P>Besides, we don&#146;t want to optimize until the design is refined to our satisfaction, and that won&#146;t be the case until we&#146;ve thought about other approaches.
</P>
<H4 ALIGN="LEFT"><A NAME="Heading11"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">Always Consider the Alternatives</FONT></H4>
<P>Listing 1.4 is good, but let&#146;s see if there are other&#151;perhaps less obvious&#151;ways to get the same results faster. Let&#146;s start by considering why Listing 1.4 is so much better than Listing 1.1. Like <B>read()</B>, <B>getc()</B> calls DOS to read from the file; the speed improvement of Listing 1.4 over Listing 1.1 occurs because <B>getc()</B> eads many bytes at once via DOS, then manages those bytes for us. That&#146;s faster than reading them one at a time using <B>read()</B>&#151;but there&#146;s no reason to think that it&#146;s faster than having our program read and manage blocks itself. Easier, yes, but not faster.</P>
<P>Consider this: Every invocation of <B>getc()</B> involves pushing a parameter, executing a call to the C library function, getting the parameter (in the C library code), looking up information about the desired stream, unbuffering the next byte from the stream, and returning to the calling code. That takes a considerable amount of time, especially by contrast with simply maintaining a pointer to a buffer and whizzing through the data in the buffer inside a single loop.</P>
<P>There are four reasons that many programmers would give for not trying to improve on Listing 1.4:</P>
<DL>
<DD><B>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The code is already fast enough.
<DD><B>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The code works, and some people are content with code that works, even when it&#146;s slow enough to be annoying.
<DD><B>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The C library is written in optimized assembly, and it&#146;s likely to be faster than any code that the average programmer could write to perform essentially the same function.
<DD><B>4.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The C library conveniently handles the buffering of file data, and it would be a nuisance to have to implement that capability.
</DL>
<P>I&#146;ll ignore the first reason, both because performance is no longer an issue if the code is fast enough and because the current application does <I>not</I> run fast enough&#151;13 seconds is a long time. (Stop and wait for 13 seconds while you&#146;re doing something intense, and you&#146;ll see just how long it is.)</P>
<P>The second reason is the hallmark of the mediocre programmer. Know when optimization matters&#151;and then optimize when it does!</P><P><BR></P>
