#### Sweet Spot Revisited {#Heading9}

Way back in Volume 1, Number 1 of *PC TECHNIQUES*, (April/May 1990) I
wrote the very first of that magazine's HAX (\#1), which extolled the
virtues of placing your most commonly-used automatic (stack-based)
variables within the stack's "sweet spot," the area between +127 to -128
bytes away from BP, the stack frame pointer. The reason was that the
8088 can store addressing displacements that fall within that range in a
single byte; larger displacements require a full word of storage,
increasing code size by a byte per instruction, and thereby slowing down
performance due to increased instruction fetching time.

This takes on new prominence in 386 native mode, where straying from the
sweet spot costs not one, but two or three bytes. Where the 8088 had two
possible displacement sizes, either byte or word, on the 386 there are
three possible sizes: byte, word, or dword. In native mode (32-bit
protected mode), however, a prefix byte is needed in order to use a
word-sized displacement, so a variable located outside the sweet spot
requires either two extra bytes (an extra displacement byte plus a
prefix byte) or three extra bytes (a dword displacement rather than a
byte displacement). Either way, instructions grow alarmingly.

Performance may or may not suffer from missing the sweet spot, depending
on the processor, the memory architecture, and the code mix. On a 486,
prefix bytes often cost a cycle; on a 386SX, increased code size often
slows performance because instructions must be fetched through the
half-pint 16-bit bus; on a 386, the effect depends on the instruction
mix and whether there's a cache.

In assembly, it's easy to control the organization of your stack frame.
In C, however, you'll have to figure out the allocation scheme your
compiler uses to allocate automatic variables, and declare automatics
appropriately to produce the desired effect. It can be done: I did it in
Turbo C some years back, and trimmed the size of a program (admittedly,
a large one) by several Kâ€”not bad, when you consider that the "sweet
spot" optimization is essentially free, with no code reorganization,
change in logic, or heavy thinking involved.
