<H3><A NAME="Heading11"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">Split Screens in Other Modes</FONT></H3>
<P>So far we&#146;ve only discussed the split screen in mode 10H. What about other modes? Generally, the split screen works in any mode; the basic rule is that when a scan line on the screen matches the split screen scan line, the internal display memory pointer is reset to zero. I&#146;ve found this to be true even in oddball modes, such as line-doubled CGA modes and the 320&#215;200 256-color mode (which is really a 320&#215;400 mode with each line repeated. For split-screen purposes, the VGA and EGA seem to count purely in scan lines, not in rows or doubled scan lines or the like. However, I have run into small anomalies in those modes on clones, and I haven&#146;t tested all modes (nor, lord knows, all clones!) so be careful when using the split screen in modes other than modes 0DH-12H, and test your code on a variety of hardware.
</P>
<P>Come to think of it, I warn you about the hazards of running fancy VGA code on clones pretty often, don&#146;t I? Ah, well&#151;just one of the hazards of the diversity and competition of the PC market! It is a fact of life, though&#151;if you&#146;re a commercial developer and don&#146;t test your video code on at least half a dozen VGAs, you&#146;re living dangerously.</P>
<P>What of the split screen in text mode? It works fine; in fact, it not only resets the internal memory pointer to zero, but also resets the text scan line counter&#151;which marks which line within the font you&#146;re on&#151;to zero, so the split screen starts out with a full row of text. There&#146;s only one trick with text mode: When split screen pel panning suppression is on, the pel panning setting is forced to 0 for the rest of the frame. Unfortunately, 0 is <I>not</I> the &#147;no-panning&#148; setting for 9-dot-wide text; 8 is. The result is that when you turn on split screen pel panning suppression, the text in the split screen won&#146;t pan with the normal screen, as intended, but will also display the undesirable characteristic of moving one pixel to the left. Whether this causes any noticeable on-screen effects depends on the text displayed by a particular application; for example, there should be no problem if the split screen has a border of blanks on the left side.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading12"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">How Safe?</FONT></H3>
<P>So, how safe <I>is</I> it to use the split screen? My opinion is that it&#146;s perfectly safe, although I&#146;d welcome input from people with extensive split screen experience&#151;and the effects are striking enough that the split screen is well worth using in certain applications.</P>
<P>I&#146;m a little more leery of horizontal smooth scrolling, with or without the split screen. Still, the Wilton book doesn&#146;t advise any particular caution, and I haven&#146;t heard any horror stories from the field lately, so the clone manufacturers must finally have gotten it right. (I vividly remember some early clones years back that <I>didn&#146;t</I> quite get it right.) So, on balance, I&#146;d say to use horizontal smooth scrolling if you really need it; on the other hand, in fast animation you can often get away with byte scrolling, which is easier, faster, and safer. (I recently saw a game that scrolled as smoothly as you could ever want. It was only by stopping it with Ctrl-NumLock that I was able to be sure that it was, in fact, byte panning, not pel panning.)</P>
<P>In short, use the fancy stuff&#151;but only when you have</P><P><BR></P>
