## Chapter 16\
 There Ain't No Such Thing as the Fastest Code {#Heading1}

### Lessons Learned in the Pursuit of the Ultimate Word Counter {#Heading2}

I remember reading an overview of C++ development tools for Windows in a
past issue of *PC Week*. In the lower left corner was the familiar box
listing the 10 leading concerns of corporate buyers when it comes to
C++. Boiled down, the list looked like this, in order of descending
importance to buyers:

**1.**  Debugging

**2.**  Documentation

**3.**  Windows development tools

**4.**  High-level Windows support

**5.**  Class library

**6.**  Development cycle efficiency

**7.**  Object-oriented development aids

**8.**  Programming management aids

**9.**  Online help

**10.**  Windows development cycle automation

Is something missing here? You bet your maximum *gluteus* something's
missing—nowhere on that list is there so much as one word about how fast
the compiled code runs! I'm not saying that performance is everything,
but optimization isn't even down there at number 10, below online help!
Ye gods and little fishes! We are talking here about people who would
take a bus from LA to New York instead of a plane because it had a
cleaner bathroom; who would choose a painting from a Holiday Inn over a
Matisse because it had a fancier frame; who would buy a Yugo instead
of—well, hell, anything—because it had a nice owner's manual and
particularly attractive keys. We are talking about people who are
focusing on means, and have forgotten about ends. We are talking about
people with no programming souls.

### Counting Words in a Hurry {#Heading3}

What are we to make of this? At the very least, we can safely guess that
very few corporate buyers ever enter optimization contests. Most of my
readers do, however; in fact, far more than I thought ever would, but
that gladdens me to no end. I issued my first optimization challenge in
a "Pushing the Envelope" column in *PC TECHNIQUES* back in 1991, and was
deluged by respondents who, one might also gather, do not live by *PC
Week*.

That initial challenge was sparked by a column David Gerrold wrote (also
in *PC TECHNIQUES* ) concerning the matter of counting the number of
words in a document; David turned up some pretty interesting
optimization issues along the way. David did all his coding in Pascal,
pointing out that while an assembly language version would probably be
faster, his Pascal utility worked properly and was fast enough for him.

It wasn't, however, fast enough for me. The logical starting place for
speeding up word counting would be David's original Pascal code, but I'm
much more comfortable with C, so Listing 16.1 is a loose approximation
of David's word count program, translated to C. I left out a few
details, such as handling comment blocks, partly because I don't use
such blocks myself, and partly so we can focus on optimizing the core
word-counting code. As Table 16.1 indicates, Listing 16.1 counts the
words in a 104,448-word file in 4.6 seconds. The file was stored on a
RAM disk, and Listing 16.1 was compiled with Borland C++ with all
optimization enabled. A RAM disk was used partly because it returns
consistent times—no seek times, rotational latency, or cache to muddy
the waters—and partly to highlight word-counting speed rather than disk
access speed.

| Listing                      | Time to Count Words |
|------------------------------|---------------------|
| 16.1 (C)                     | 4.6 seconds         |
| 16.2 & 16.3 (C+ASM)          | 2.4 seconds         |
| 16.2 & 16.4 (C+ASM w/lookup) | 1.6 seconds         |

Table: Table 16.1 Word count timings.

These are the times taken to search a file containing 104,448 words,
timed from a RAM disk on a 20 MHz 386.
