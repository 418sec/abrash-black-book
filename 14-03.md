How fast *is* Boyer-Moore? Listing 14.1 is a C implementation of
Boyer-Moore searching; Listing 14.2 is a test-bed program that searches
up to the first 32K of a file for a pattern. Table 14.1 (all times
measured with Turbo Profiler on a 20 MHz cached 386, searching a
modified version of the text of this chapter) shows that this
implementation is generally much slower than `REPNZ SCASB`, although
it does come close when searching for long patterns. Listing 14.1 is
designed primarily to make later assembly implemenmore comprehensible,
rather than faster; Sedge's implementation uses arrays rather than
pointers, is a great deal more compact and very clever, and may be
somewhat faster. Regardless, the far superior performance of `REPNZ
SCASB` clearly indicates that assembly language is in order at this
point.

The entry "Standard Boyer-Moore in ASM" in Table 14.1 refers to
straight-forward hand optimization of Listing 14.1, code that is not
included in this chapter for the perfectly good reason that it is slower
in most cases than `REPNZ SCASB`. I say this casually now, but not so
yesterday, when I had all but concluded that Boyer-Moore was simply
inferior on the x86, due to two architectural quirks: the string
instructions and slow branch. I had even coined a neat phrase for it:
Architecture is destiny. Has a nice ring, doesn't it?
