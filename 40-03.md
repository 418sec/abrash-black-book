### Complex Polygon Filling: An Implementation {#Heading5}

Listing 40.1 just shown presents a function, **FillPolygon()**, that
fills polygons of all shapes. If **CONVEX\_FILL\_LINKED** is defined,
the fast convex fill code from Chapter 39 is linked in and used to draw
convex polygons. Otherwise, convex polygons are handled as if they were
complex. Nonconvex polygons are also handled as complex, although this
is not necessary, as discussed shortly.

Listing 40.1 is a faithful implementation of the complex polygon filling
approach just described, with separate functions corresponding to each
of the tasks, such as building the GET and X-sorting the AET. Listing
40.2 provides the actual drawing code used to fill spans, built on a
draw pixel routine that is the only hardware dependency anywhere in the
C code. Listing 40.3 is the header file for the polygon filling code;
note that it is an expanded version of the header file used by the fast
convex polygon fill code from Chapter 39. (They may have the same name
but are *not* the same file!) Listing 40.4 is a sample program that,
when linked to Listings 40.1 and 40.2, demonstrates drawing polygons of
various sorts.
