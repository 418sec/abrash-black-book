Listing 16.2 is Listing 16.1 modified to call a function that scans each
block for words, and Listing 16.3 contains an assembly function that
counts words. Used together, Listings 16.2 and 16.3 are just about twice
as fast as Listing 16.1, a good return for a little assembly language.
Listing 16.3 is a pretty straightforward translation from C to assembly;
the new code makes good use of registers, but the key code—determining
whether each byte is a character or not—is still done with the same
multiple-sequential-tests approach used by the code that the C compiler
generates.

#### Which Way to Go from Here? {#Heading4}

We could rearrange the tests in light of the nature of the data being
scanned; for example, we could perform the tests more efficiently by
taking advantage of the knowledge that if a byte is less than ‘0,' it's
either an apostrophe or not a character at all. However, that sort of
fine-tuning is typically good for speedups of only 10 to 20 percent, and
I've intentionally refrained from implementing this in Listing 16.3 to
avoid pointing you down the wrong path; what we need is a different tack
altogether. Ponder this. What we *really* want to know is nothing more
than whether a byte is a character, not what sort of character it is.
For each byte value, we want a yes/no status, and nothing else—and that
description practically begs for a lookup table. Listing 16.4 uses a
lookup table approach to boost performance another 50 percent, to three
times the performance of the original C code. On a 20 MHz 386, this
represents a change from 4.6 to 1.6 seconds, which could be
significant—who likes to wait? On an 8088, the improvement in
word-counting a large file could easily be 10 or 20 seconds, which is
*definitely* significant.
