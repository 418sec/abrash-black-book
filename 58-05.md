And there you have it: A five to 10-times speedup of a decent assembly
language texture mapper. All it took was some help from my friends, a
good, stiff jolt of right-brain thinking, and some solid left-brain
polishing—plus the knowledge that such a speedup was possible. Treat
every optimization task as if John Miles has just written to inform you
that he's made it faster than your wildest dreams, and you'll be amazed
at what you can do!

### Texture Mapping Notes {#Heading8}

Listing 58.3 contains no 486 pipeline stalls; it has Pentium stalls, but
not much can be done for them because of the size prefix on `ADD
EDX,ECX`, which takes 1 cycle to go through the U-pipe, and shuts down
the V-pipe for that cycle. Listing 58.4, on the other hand, has been
rearranged to eliminate all Pentium stalls save one. When the Y
coordinate fractional part carries and ESI advances, the code executes
as follows:

```nasm
ADD ESI,ECX     ;cycle 1 U-pipe
AND DH,NOT 80H  ;cycle 1 V-pipe
                ;cycle 2 idle AGI on ESI
MOV BL,[ESI]    ;cycle 3 U-pipe
ADD EDX,EBP     ;cycle 3 V-pipe
```

However, I don't see any way to eliminate this last AGI, which happens
about half the time; even with it, the Pentium execution time for
Listing 58.4 is 5.5 cycles. That's 61 nanoseconds—a highly respectable
16 million texture-mapped pixels per second—on a 90 MHz Pentium.

The type of texture mapping discussed in both this and earlier chapters
doesn't do perspective correction when mapping textures. Why that is and
how to handle perspective correction is a topic for a whole separate
book, but be aware that the textures on some large polygons (not the
polygon edges themselves) drawn with the code in this chapter will
appear to be unnaturally bowed, although small polygons should look
fine.

Finally, we never did get rid of the last jump in the texture mapper,
yet John Miles claimed no jumps at all. How did he do it? I'm not sure,
but I'd guess that he used a two-entry look-up table, based on the Y
carry, to decide how much to advance the source pointer in Y. However, I
couldn't come up with any implementation of this approach that didn't
take 0.5 to 1 cycle more than the test-and-jump approach, so either I
didn't come up with an adequately efficient implementation of the table,
John saved a cycle somewhere else, or perhaps John implemented his code
in a 32-bit segment, but used the less-efficient table in his fervor to
get rid of the final jump. The knowledge that I apparently came up with
a different solution than John highlights that the technical aspects of
John's implementation were, in truth, totally irrelevant to my
optimization efforts; the only actual effect John's code had on me was
to make me *believe* a texture mapper could run that fast.

Believe it! And while you're at it, give both halves of your brain equal
time—and watch out for aliens in short skirts, 60's bouffant hairdos,
and an undue interest in either half.
