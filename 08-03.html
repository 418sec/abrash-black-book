  <p>The main body of Listing 8.1 constructs a linked list of memory blocks of various sizes and stores an array of structures across those blocks, as shown in Figure 8.2. The function <b>FindIDAverage</b> in Listing 8.1 searches through that array for all matches to a specified ID number and returns the average value of all such matches. <b>FindIDAverage</b> contains two nested loops, the outer one repeating once for each linked block and the inner one repeating once for each array element in each block. The inner loop&mdash;the critical one&mdash;is compact, containing only four statements, and should lend itself rather well to compiler optimization.</p>

  <b>Figure 8.2</b></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Linked array storage format (version 1).</i></p>

  <p>As it happens, Microsoft C/C<small>++</small> does optimize the inner loop of <b>FindIDAverage</b> nicely. Listing 8.2 shows the code Microsoft C/C<small>++</small> generates for the inner loop, consisting of a mere seven assembly language instructions inside the loop. The compiler is smart enough to convert the loop index variable, which counts up but is used for nothing but counting loops, into a count-down variable so that the <b>LOOP</b> instruction can be used.</p>
