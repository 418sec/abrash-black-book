<P>There are many people to thank&#151;because this book was written over many years, in many different settings, an unusually large number of people have played a part in making this book possible. Thanks to Dan Illowsky for not only contributing ideas and encouragement, but also getting me started writing articles long ago, when I lacked the confidence to do it on my own&#151;and for teaching me how to handle the business end of things. Thanks to Will Fastie for giving me my first crack at writing for a large audience in the long-gone but still-missed <I>PC Tech Journal</I>, and for showing me how much fun it could be in his even longer-vanished but genuinely terrific column in <I>Creative Computing</I> (the most enjoyable single column I have ever read in a computer magazine; I used to haunt the mailbox around the beginning of the month just to see what Will had to say). Thanks to Robert Keller, Erin O&#146;Connor, Liz Oakley, Steve Baker, and the rest of the cast of thousands that made <I>Programmer&#146;s Journal</I> a uniquely fun magazine&#151;especially Erin, who did more than anyone to teach me the proper use of the English language. (To this day, Erin will still patiently explain to me when one should use &#147;that&#148; and when one should use &#147;which,&#148; even though eight years of instruction on this and related topics have left no discernible imprint on my brain.) Thanks to Tami Zemel, Monica Berg, and the rest of the <I>Dr. Dobb&#146;s Journal</I> crew for excellent, professional editing, and for just being great people. Thanks to the Coriolis gang for their tireless hard work: Jeff Duntemann, Kim Eoff, Jody Kent, Robert Clarfield, and Anthony Stock. Thanks to Jack Tseng for teaching me a lot about graphics hardware, and even more about how much difference hard work can make. Thanks to John Cockerham, David Stafford, Terje Mathisen, the BitMan, Chris Hecker, Jim Mackraz, Melvin Lafitte, John Navas, Phil Coleman, Anton Truenfels, John Carmack, John Miles, John Bridges, Jim Kent, Hal Hardenbergh, Dave Miller, Steve Levy, Jack Davis, Duane Strong, Daev Rohr, Bill Weber, Dan Gochnauer, Patrick Milligan, Tom Wilson, Peter Klerings, Dave Methvin, Mick Brown, the people in the ibm.pc/fast.code topic on Bix, and all the rest of you who have been so generous with your ideas and suggestions. I&#146;ve done my best to acknowledge contributors by name in this book, but if your name is omitted, my apologies, and consider yourself thanked; this book could not have happened without you. And, of course, thanks to Shay and Emily for their generous patience with my passion for writing and computers.</P><P><BR></P>
