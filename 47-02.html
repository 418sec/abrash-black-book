  <p>Given the tremendous advantages of Mode X over the documented mode 13H, I&rsquo;d very much like to get it into the hands of as many developers as possible, so I&rsquo;m going to spend the next few chapters exploring this odd but worthy mode. I&rsquo;ll provide mode set code, delineate the bitmap organization, and show how the basic write pixel and read pixel operations work. Then, I&rsquo;ll move on to the magic stuff: rectangle fills, screen clears, scrolls, image copies, pixel inversion, and, yes, polygon fills (just a different driver for the polygon code), all blurry fast; hardware raster ops; and page flipping. In the end, I&rsquo;ll build a working animation program that shows many of the features of Mode X in action.</p>

  <p>The mode set code is the logical place to begin.</p>

  <h3 id="Heading4">Selecting 320x240 256-Color Mode</h3>

  <p>We could, if we wished, write our own mode set code for Mode X from scratch&mdash;but why bother? Instead, we&rsquo;ll let the BIOS do most of the work by having it set up mode 13H, which we&rsquo;ll then turn into Mode X by changing a few registers. Listing 47.1 does exactly that.</p>

  <p>The code in Listing 47.1 has been around for some time, and the very first version had a bug that serves up an interesting lesson. The original <i>DDJ</i> version made images roll on IBM&rsquo;s fixed-frequency VGA monitors, a problem that didn&rsquo;t come to my attention until the code was in print and shipped to 100,000 readers.</p>

  <p>The bug came about this way: The code I modified to make the Mode X mode set code used the VGA&rsquo;s 28-MHz clock. Mode X should have used the 25-MHz clock, a simple matter of setting bit 2 of the Miscellaneous Output register (3C2H) to 0 instead of 1.</p>

  <p>Alas, I neglected to change that single bit, so frames were drawn at a faster rate than they should have been; however, both of my monitors are multifrequency types, and they automatically compensated for the faster frame rate. Consequently, my clock-selection bug was invisible and innocuous&mdash;until it was distributed broadly and everybody started banging on it.</p>

  <p>IBM makes only fixed-frequency VGA monitors, which require very specific frame rates; if they don&rsquo;t get what you&rsquo;ve told them to expect, the image rolls. The corrected version is the one shown here as Listing 47.1; it does select the 25-MHz clock, and works just fine on fixed-frequency monitors.</p>

  <p>Why didn&rsquo;t I catch this bug? Neither I nor a single one of my testers had a fixed-frequency monitor! This nicely illustrates how difficult it is these days to test code in all the PC-compatible environments in which it might run. The problem is particularly severe for small developers, who can&rsquo;t afford to buy every model of every hardware component from every manufacturer; just imagine trying to test network-aware software in all possible configurations!</p>

  <p>When people ask why software isn&rsquo;t bulletproof; why it crashes or doesn&rsquo;t coexist with certain programs; why PC clones aren&rsquo;t always compatible; why, in short, the myriad irritations of using a PC exist&mdash;this is a big part of the reason. I guess that&rsquo;s just the price we pay for the unfettered creativity and vast choice of the PC market.</p>
