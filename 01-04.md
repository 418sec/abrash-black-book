In this case that means knowing how DOS and the C/C++ file-access
libraries do their work. In other words, *know the territory*!

    * from the specified file. Obtains the bytes one at a time via
    * getc(), allowing C to perform data buffering.
    */
    #include <stdio.h>

    main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
          FILE *CheckFile;
          int Byte;
          unsigned int Checksum;

          if ( argc != 2 ) {
                printf("usage: checksum filename\n");
                exit(1);
          }
          if ( (CheckFile = fopen(argv[1], "rb")) == NULL ) {

          /* Add each byte in turn into the checksum accumulator */
          while ( (Byte = getc(CheckFile)) != EOF ) {
                Checksum += (unsigned int) Byte;
          }

#### Know When It Matters {#Heading10}

The last section contained a particularly interesting phrase: *the
time-critical portions of your code*. Time-critical portions of your
code are those portions in which the speed of the code makes a
significant difference in the overall performance of your program—and by
"significant," I don't mean that it makes the code 100 percent faster,
or 200 percent, or any particular amount at all, but rather that it
makes the program more responsive and/or usable *from the user's
perspective*.

Don't waste time optimizing non-time-critical code: set-up code,
initialization code, and the like. Spend your time improving the
performance of the code inside heavily-used loops and in the portions of
your programs that directly affect response time. Notice, for example,
that I haven't bothered to implement a version of the checksum program
entirely in assembly; Listings 1.2 and 1.6 call assembly subroutines
that handle the time-critical operations, but C is still used for
checking command-line parameters, operning files, printing, and the
like.

  ![](images/i.jpg)   *If you were to implement any of the listings in this chapter entirely in hand-optimized assembly, I suppose you might get a performance improvement of a few percent—but I rather doubt you'd get even that much, and you'd sure as heck spend an awful lot of time for whatever meager improvement does result. Let C do what it does well, and use assembly only when it makes a perceptible difference.*

Besides, we don't want to optimize until the design is refined to our
satisfaction, and that won't be the case until we've thought about other
approaches.

#### Always Consider the Alternatives {#Heading11}

Listing 1.4 is good, but let's see if there are other—perhaps less
obvious—ways to get the same results faster. Let's start by considering
why Listing 1.4 is so much better than Listing 1.1. Like **read()**,
**getc()** calls DOS to read from the file; the speed improvement of
Listing 1.4 over Listing 1.1 occurs because **getc()** eads many bytes
at once via DOS, then manages those bytes for us. That's faster than
reading them one at a time using **read()**—but there's no reason to
think that it's faster than having our program read and manage blocks
itself. Easier, yes, but not faster.

Consider this: Every invocation of **getc()** involves pushing a
parameter, executing a call to the C library function, getting the
parameter (in the C library code), looking up information about the
desired stream, unbuffering the next byte from the stream, and returning
to the calling code. That takes a considerable amount of time,
especially by contrast with simply maintaining a pointer to a buffer and
whizzing through the data in the buffer inside a single loop.

There are four reasons that many programmers would give for not trying
to improve on Listing 1.4:

**1.**  The code is already fast enough.

**2.**  The code works, and some people are content with code that
works, even when it's slow enough to be annoying.

**3.**  The C library is written in optimized assembly, and it's likely
to be faster than any code that the average programmer could write to
perform essentially the same function.

**4.**  The C library conveniently handles the buffering of file data,
and it would be a nuisance to have to implement that capability.

I'll ignore the first reason, both because performance is no longer an
issue if the code is fast enough and because the current application
does *not* run fast enough—13 seconds is a long time. (Stop and wait for
13 seconds while you're doing something intense, and you'll see just how
long it is.)

The second reason is the hallmark of the mediocre programmer. Know when
optimization matters—and then optimize when it does!
