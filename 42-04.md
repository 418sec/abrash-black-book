Listing 42.1 isn't particularly fast, because it calls `DrawPixel()`
for each pixel. On the other hand, `DrawPixel()` makes it easy to try
out Wu antialiasing in a variety of modes; just adapt the code in
Listing 42.3 for the 256-color mode you want to support. For example,
Listing 42.5 shows code to draw Wu-antialiased lines in 640x480
256-color mode on SuperVGAs built around the Tseng Labs ET4000 chip with
at least 512K of display memory installed. It's well worth checking out
Wu antialiasing at 640x480. Although antialiased lines look much
smoother than normal lines at 320x200 resolution, they're far from
perfect, because the pixels are so big that the eye can't blend them
properly. At 640x480, however, Wu-antialiased lines look fabulous; from
a couple of feet away, they look as straight and smooth as if they were
drawn with a ruler.

/* Mode set and pixel-drawing functions for the 640x480 256-color mode of

 */
#include <dos.h>

/* Screen dimension globals, used in main program to scale */
int ScreenWidthInPixels = 640;
int ScreenHeightInPixels = 480;

/* ET4000 640x480 256-color draw pixel function. */
void DrawPixel(int X, int Y, int Color)
{
#define SCREEN_SEGMENT        0xA000
#define GC_SEGMENT_SELECT     0x3CD /* ET4000 segment (bank) select reg */
   unsigned char far *ScreenPtr;
   unsigned int Bank;
   unsigned long BitmapAddress;

   /* full bitmap address of pixel, as measured from address 0 to 0xFFFFF */
   BitmapAddress = (unsigned long) Y * ScreenWidthInPixels + X;
   /* Bank # is upper word of bitmap addr */
   Bank = BitmapAddress >> 16;
   /* Upper nibble is read bank #, lower nibble is write bank # */
   outp(GC_SEGMENT_SELECT, (Bank << 4) | Bank);
   /* Draw into the bank */
   FP_SEG(ScreenPtr) = SCREEN_SEGMENT;
   FP_OFF(ScreenPtr) = (unsigned int) BitmapAddress;
   *ScreenPtr = Color;
}

/* ET4000 640x480 256-color mode-set function. */
void SetMode()
{
   union REGS regset;

   /* Set to 640x480 256-color graphics mode */
   regset.x.ax = 0x002E;
   int86(0x10, &regset, &regset);
}
```

Listing 42.1 requires that the DAC palette be set up so that a
`NumLevel`-long block of palette entries contains linearly decreasing
intensities of the drawing color. The size of the block is programmable,
but must be a power of two. The more intensity levels, the better. Wu
says that 32 intensities are enough; on my system, eight and even four
levels looked pretty good. I found that gamma correction, which gives
linearly spaced intensity steps, improved antialiasing quality
significantly. Fortunately, we can program the palette with
gamma-corrected values, so our drawing code doesn't have to do any extra
work.

Listing 42.1 isn't very fast, so I implemented Wu antialiasing in
assembly, hard-coded for mode 13H. The implementation is shown in full
in Listing 42.6. High-speed graphics code and fast VGAs go together like
peanut butter and jelly, which is to say very well indeed; the assembly
implementation ran more than twice as fast as the C code on my 486.
Enough said!
