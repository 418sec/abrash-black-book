### Overscan {#Heading5}

While we're at it, I'm going to touch on overscan. Overscan is the color
of the border of the display, the rectangular area around the edge of
the monitor that's outside the region displaying active video data but
inside the blanking area. The overscan (or border) color can be
programmed to any of the 64 possible colors by either setting Attribute
Controller register 11H directly or calling video function 10H,
subfunction 1.

> ![](images/i.jpg)
> On ECD-compatible monitors, however, there's too little scan time to
> display a proper border when the EGA is in 350-scan-line mode, so
> overscan should always be 0 (black) unless you're in 200-scanmode. Note,
> though, that a VGA can easily display a border on a VGA-compatible
> monitor, and VGAs are in fact programmed at mode set for an 8-pixel-wide
> border in all modes; all you need do is set the overscan color on any
> VGA to see the border.

### A Bonus Blanker {#Heading6}

An interesting bonus: The Attribute Controller provides a very
convenient way to blank the screen, in the form of the aforementioned
bit 5 of the Attribute Controller Index register (at address 3C0H after
the Input Status 1 register—3DAH in color, 3BAH in monochrome—has been
read and on every other write to 3C0H thereafter). Whenever bit 5 of the
AC Index register is 0, video data is cut off, effectively blanking the
screen. Setting bit 5 of the AC Index back to 1 restores video data
immediately. Listing 29.4 illustrates this simple but effective form of
screen blanking.
